Training
EHR Training is the foundation and ground-work for all Epic implementation projects. We believe in providing the absolute best quality in training, as it is an integral part of a successful implementation.
314e employs Epic Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to screen and hire “best-of-the-best” trainers to ensure the highest quality and best fit for your Epic implementation needs. We offer training solutions from start-to-finish of Epic implementations, as well as solutions that support continual training needs for new hires, upgrades and optimizations.
EHR Training Services
Training Management and Subject Matter Experts
We develop, implement and lead your training programs from beginning to end, and beyond. We employ the best EHR training talent in the market to ensure the success of your project.
Instructional Designers / Principal Trainers
We offer application implementation through Epic Certified Consultants with years of application-specific knowledge and experience. Our curriculum design is customized to your organization. Our SMEs can create, modify and deliver training content specific to your needs and workflows. 
We take care of the MST build, including the training environment management, strategy and patient build.
Credentialed Trainers / Support Staff
We provide classroom training, one-on-one training, virtual training and support with a team of highly skilled and experienced trainers, hand-picked by our Training Director. We also conduct trainings via webinar, WebEx and eLearning solutions in a scalable and successful model. Our Credentialed Trainers can deliver more than just classroom training personalization, STS augmentation, and support. Many of our Credentialed Trainers are actually certified in Epic Modules.
Additional Training Support
Playground Workshop Support
314e provides support and strategy for “open lab” events, utilizing Epic’s playground environment. These efforts support ongoing learning and strengthen end users’ knowledge, usage and comfort level with the system.
eLearning Reviews
Providing a “one size fits all” model is a sure-shot recipe for failure in eLearning. We review your current eLearning content and strategies and propose the right eLearning strategy for your team. Our team can either create or refresh your eLearning library. Our highly skilled Epic SMEs and trainers assist in targeted and workflow-specific content for your end users, to make them highly effective and efficient with the system.
Quick Reference Guide Development
Quick reference guides are always a key component for support at go-live and post go-live situations. 314e assists in developing and modifying QRGs that are specific to your organization and workflows.
Workflow Change Reference Guide Development
Sometimes workflows need to change on a moment’s notice.  Our team can help you in workflow change reference guide creation and dissemination of information. We will make sure that your end users are aware of changes in real-time.
Tip Sheet Creation and Development
Tip Sheets are always important for end users’ reference when they get stuck, or forget how to do something in the system. 314e provides highly-trained and experienced SMEs to create easy to use, accurate and concise tip-sheets customized for different types of users in your system.
Lead and Support Training
314e has multiple solutions for classroom EHR training. Whether you are looking for classroom training sessions, or back-up support to your classroom setting, we have skilled, talented and experienced trainers for all classroom situations.
STS Implementation and Project Management
While the STS format for provider training can be challenging for organizations, we assist in strategies and provide your organization with professionals who solely focus on Epic’s STS model. Our Project Managers, Instructional Designers, and Credentialed Trainers that have experience in STS will solely focus on the success of implementing this model for your organization.
Integrated Testing Support
Testing is critical to ensure there are no surprises for your users when they go-live. 314e can provide experienced technical resources for your testing activities. Our EHR training consultants are often utilized by the testing team to assess workflows and build. Their understanding of Epic and your workflows ensures highest quality build rollout for your users.
Appointment Conversion Workshops
Important pre-go-live functions like appointment conversion workshops can be quite cumbersome. 314e provides skilled and experienced support to assist in all pre-go-live activities, including appointment conversion and chart abstraction assistance.
Template Build Workshops
Physicians need schedules built-out in your production environment, prior to go-live. This is a daunting task for your end-users. 314e provides the necessary support to build out department and physician schedules, taking away the complication in the process for your team.
Technical Dress Rehearsal (TDR)
314e provides support personnel for Technical Dress Rehearsal (TDR). Utilizing highly skilled and experienced TDR professionals can prepare you for go-live more effectively.  We provide the resources, documentation, processes and consulting to ensure your success.
"314e was selected through an RFP Process to provide a team of Credentialed Trainers and Go-Live support for Baylor Scott & White Health for our on-going North Texas Acute Epic implementations.  From the start, I have been very impressed with their candidate vetting process to identify top talent, their ease of handling the onboarding of their resources to our project and the ongoing attention to us from their account management team.  The end user evaluations are showing excellent feedback from our clinical leaders and we couldn’t be happier.  314e has met and continues to exceed my expectations. They are a true partner."

Muspell Automaton
314e’s Automation Framework called Muspell Automaton brings together state of the art technologies to help organizations integrate, aggregate and automate data and workflows. We give you technology that has best of breed options for workflow automation including the ability to trigger workflows based on events including Cron, HL7/ANSI X12 messages, file changes and notifications.
Highly customizable workflows according to organization needs
Cloud-scaling based on serverless functions running in Kubernetes clusters
Hundreds of pre-built bots to get you started
Why use Muspell Automaton?
You may be using UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism, WorkFusion or other similar solutions, but disparate RPA bots can only get you so far.
Muspell Automaton brings out the real value of your RPA bots by organizing them based on your custom process workflows.
Using Muspell Automaton, you can create your own Workflows and Rules Engine, orchestrate tasks and create exceptions to accomplish process wins and not just task wins.
Now, that makes Automaton your best Automation Buddy!
Complex made simple
Muspell Automaton can be used to automate complex tasks spanning across multiple IT infrastructure, software platforms and databases. Take an example of one of our most successful automation workflows – Automated Claim Status Retrieval. This workflow connects to the EHR, PMS, Insurance Databases, 3rd Party Aggregators, Rules Engine and allows you to customize things on the fly.
Ever increasing Bots collection
314e is continuously creating Bots to automate a variety of tasks like data retrieval, formatting, comparison, filtering, decision making and allocating. Over the last 15 years of existence, 314e has worked with over 100 healthcare applications, we put these knowledge to use in creating “single-task” bots, that are implemented as serverless functions.
Scalable Architecture
RPA’s purpose will be defeated if it cannot scale to accommodate large quantities of data or a variety of tasks.
Muspell Automaton utilizes open source systems like Kubernetes (K8S) for deployment, scaling and management of applications included in containers (Docker or others).
This allows the ability to create a cluster of machines to replicate the services in execution.
Customize on the go
Muspell Automaton is extremely flexible and allows you to make workflow modifications on the go. You could edit the rules engine on the fly and the framework takes care of the rest.
Multiple initiation triggers
Any RPA workflow must support multiple initiation mechanisms for the bots. Muspell Automaton supports a variety of triggers like:
CRON based – Run at a fixed frequency, for example, every morning at 0500 hours
Event based – Run when an event occurs, like, receipt of a file or an HL7 message
UI based – Based on user actions
Rules based – When certain conditions are met
Sample use cases of Muspell Automaton in Healthcare Settings
Appointment scheduling for patients
Patient payment management and account settlement
Verification of Eligibility & Benefits before service
Charge entry, scrubbing & submission
Claim status retrieval (AR follow-up)
Discharge instructions & Medication guidelines
314e’s Muspell Automaton can solve your most complex problems. Talk to one of our RPA experts today!
"My team now gets a daily updated list of Paid/Denied/Follow-up Needed claims on their work queues first thing in the morning, and they focus on resolving claims instead of getting claim statuses. 314e has allowed my team to focus on the real work instead of being call center agents. What took a human about 5 minutes to do, is now done in a matter of seconds. That is a huge gain for us."

EHR Implementation Services
Health Systems that undertake the journey to implement a EHR are not only making a significant financial investment, they are also investing in the future and quality of patient care for their community. The success of an EHR implementation requires a partner who has the experience to ensure success. 314e has supported more than
200 EHR implementations since 2004
Experience With Many EHR Vendors
314e brings expertise to any Epic, Cerner or MEDITECH implementation. We have also contributed to numerous eClinicalWorks, Athenahealth and NextGen Ambulatory implementations. 314e’s EHR implementation experience encompasses clinical (acute and ambulatory), ancillary/departmental, patient access, revenue cycle, specialties, integration and business intelligence functionalities.
Focus on Epic Implementations

We partner with our clients throughout the implementation process to achieve long-term success.
Planning and Project Management
Our team of PMP or Agile certified Epic Project Managers guides the delivery of work to achieve the implementation objectives within the project timeline and budget. We approach projects by anticipating what will make the customer successful in the long term, even if it involves some short-term challenges.
Discovery and Workflow Validation
We compare your desired workflows and content for future state to the Epic model to identify gaps from the foundation. We then leverage an interdisciplinary governance model to determine if any variations are required to support your desired future state. A key consideration is the long-term support implications associated with any decisions to deviate from the Epic model.

Our team is involved in gathering requirements, specifications, change control procedures for end user adoption and documentation.

Our team also ensure that all workstations and other hardware work appropriately at go-live. Our certified team of instructional designers, credentialed trainers and at-the elbow (ATE) resources make sure that the appropriate Epic curriculum is created and that end users are appropriately trained before and during go-live.

EHR Advisory Services
314e’s EHR Advisory Services team becomes a part of your team to address your organization’s unique needs.
Pre-Implementation Planning
Whether it is implementing an entire new EHR or adding to it, a significant investment of your organization’s capital, time and resources is required. Comprehensive planning before embarking on such a large scale project is essential. 314e can help align your organization’s goals with clinical care, patient safety and quality. We assess gaps and create timeline to ensure there is no loss in revenue or patient safety during the
implementation
process. We coordinate processes, tools, technology and resources to ensure a successful implementation through our pre-implementation EHR advisory services.
Technology Strategy
At 314e, our passion is technology. As healthcare IT continues to evolve, organizations must not only keep up with their current solutions, but also plan ahead. Our experts are constantly learning and adapting to new and emerging technologies specific to healthcare. We can advise on your organization’s short and long term needs, presenting various alternatives that can be adapted through minimal impact. We provide in-depth analysis of existing systems and plan for your organization’s future.
Program & Project Management
Over the last decade, healthcare has been in a constant state of flux, leading to more complex IT projects. 314e provides both leadership and governance skills to help keep projects on schedule while mitigating the risks of delivery. Project management also plays an essential part of this process. We have a culture grounded in excellent project management skills. Our client stories demonstrate our ability to work complex environments. Our PMP Certified resources will meet and exceed your organization’s requirements.
Data Governance
The availability of data has enabled healthcare organizations to become more analytical in their operations. It is essential that an organization establishes policies and continuously monitor its data governance so that the right form of data is mined. 314e can help your team develop a sustainable data governance plan that encompasses stakeholders, data use limitations, ownership, liability and government regulatory requirements.

EHR Go-Live Support
314e’s EHR go-live support team has experience supporting and managing large and complex end-to-end Epic go-live programs across the country. Accessing a large pool of reliable, experienced and high quality Epic At-the-Elbow (ATE) resources can be a daunting challenge, but 314e is here to help.
We offer the highest quality candidates from our nation-wide resource pool. Start-to-finish, we offer the best options for your ATE support needs, bolstered by a track record of proven success and lessons learned on small, medium and large Epic implementations. Working with 314e helps your Epic go-live program run smoothly and successfully.
How we do it?
High-Quality-Trainers_1
Use of Credentialed Trainers
314e has been able to provide At-the-elbow support in several instances with the use of only CTs. This results in better quality support for the customer. We recognize that this is not possible in every instance, but we work hard to get as many CTs as possible on the larger go-lives. We have a proprietary candidate ranking system with multiple checks, tests and extreme vetting, which allows us to put the best resources on your projects.
Strong-Communications_1
Account Management
All routine communication, issues and escalations by your leadership team will be handled by our dedicated account management team. We provide multiple paths of escalation to offer redundancy and a quick, guaranteed turnaround time. Our account management team consists of on-site and off-site coordinators, as well as members from our leadership team, to ensure that the program governance is of the highest standard.
Logistics-Support_1
Logistics
Implementation of a well-structured and coordinated logistics support program which includes bulk hotel/room bookings, use of shuttle buses (when appropriate) to ensure attendance and punctuality are all part of our standard operating procedures for EHR go-live support.
Appropriate-Technology_1
Technology
Technology assistance with scheduling, time & attendance, reporting and communication is essential to achieving a successful training program. We use commercial off the shelf scheduling, attendance and reporting products, our proprietary scheduling solutions or a combination of both.
Our extensive go-live experience has allowed us to successfully transfer our knowledge, experience and lessons learned from one implementation to another. Our key learnings that you will benefit from are:
Go-Live-Planning_1
Go Live Planning
314e works with your leadership, project team and technical teams to plan out what the command center will look like, how it will run, ticket triage, what becomes a ticket/what becomes a direct call and so much more. We can design, deliver and implement a full Command Center Playbook which will outline every facet of the Command Center from its resurrection to when we close the doors, and the follow up procedure for business as usual once the Command Center is taken down.
Taper-Down-Model_2
Taper Down Model
We use a “Taper Down” method when it comes to Go-live Support.  This fades the support model slowly and gradually, to assist in strengthening your core staff and refrain from immediate withdrawal of support staff.  We find tapering down also helps organizations stay within their budget when utilized effectively.
Licensed-Clinician-Support-Model_1
Licensed Clinician Support  Model
Licensed Clinicians are sometimes the preferred support model for certain areas, or employee bodies such as Physicians. Affiliated Physician training should be provided by a dedicated Physician training team. 314e has a vast resource pool with Licensed Personnel, ranging from Physicians, Nurses, and Pharmacists.
Daily-Scorecards_1
Daily Scorecards
314e has developed departmental readiness scorecards that provide a straightforward and streamlined reporting process, to give your leadership a structured feedback on the stability of the departments our ATE resources are supporting, by staying close to the End Users and Super Users as they work with the new applications. This is to focus ongoing efforts to the areas and users that need continued or even increased support, as well as identifying those areas and users that are comfortable in the new system and workflows and which are returning to full productivity.
Support-Ratios-that-make-sense-to-your-Planning
Support Ratios That Make Sense to Your Planning
Many consulting firms use a “one size fits all” staffing ratio.  314e looks at various details to ensure each department and location is appropriately staffed, based on “acuity” scoring around end-user needs. We believe in doing a geographical walk through to see if there are items that would disrupt the flow of a support resource being easily accessible to a set number of people to provide support.
Login-Labs-and-Physician-Personalization_1
Login Labs and Physician  Personalization
314e has extensive experience with Go-live readiness activities like Login Labs and Physician Personalization. We recommend co-locating a security SWAT team during Go-lives to mitigate issue in real-time. We will lay the groundwork to minimize every possible risk and help win the acceptance of your clinical and non-clinical staff. We  will also analyze your system-wide workflows and recommend prerequisites to develop checklists that include all areas of readiness activities.
"314e was a primary provider of Epic training related staffing for Beaumont Health including instructional designers, credentialed trainers, and extensive at-the-elbow support resources. Overall, 314e provided high-quality Epic resources. 314e handled the entire screening, scheduling and on-boarding process for their resources which covered 100 locations. We were very happy with the quality they have provided and their prompt attention to all requests. I highly recommend their services."

4 Major Considerations For Healthcare Data Conversion
October 30, 2020
314e Employee
EHR Services
Health systems migrating from a legacy records solution to Epic EHR will no doubt reap significant benefits in the long run. However, the process to get there can be rather painful and even confusing. One of the key considerations: how to handle
healthcare data conversion to Epic
Today we’ll shed light on a few considerations worth discussing when health systems are
implementing a new EHR
and planning for legacy data handling.
Obviously there are several reasons why a healthcare entity cannot simply ditch existing data when it comes to implementing a new system. Hospitals must consider their state requirements regarding patient data retention, as well as their various contracts and CMS designations, with an understanding that
HIPAA is going to expect keeping PHI
on hand for at least six years. But there’s also the given need for providers to have continuous access to a given patient’s record without gaps in data or garbled conversion between systems (especially with discrete data).
Does The Whole Patient Record Make The Cut?
Converting data between EHR solutions is a great opportunity to mindfully evaluate the value of
existing interfaces and data inputs
When making the transition to Epic from an existing EHR system, health systems have to consider timing and strategy based on cost. There is a lot of comfort in running parallel systems for a certain period of time, but that also means twice the system upkeep and the operating costs. This can quickly turn into a logistical nightmare and liability trap, but that doesn’t mean that an instant cut-over is all sunshine and rainbows either.
Many health systems prefer a phased approach to introduce certain data sets or even select users on a new platform before making the transition across the board. Regardless of the preferred mechanism, taking into account what the care system can afford in terms of support and parallel systems up and running is a very important factor in planning for EHR data conversion.
We’ve already covered retaining ePHI above, but a topic worth some additional commentary is how end users would access archived EHR data. Many storage solutions in general sound simple enough until you consider how access would occur if and when it’s needed. The solution can be far more cumbersome in hindsight than would warrant ad hoc access, especially acutely after the initial EHR conversion period. Maybe a document repository is established and logins are readily available, for example. But when busy clinicians are expected to track down a rarely-used set of credentials and page through PDFs to fetch older records, you’re either looking at a lot of grumbling or abandonment of efforts, the latter of which could have serious implications for
continuity of care
Helping clinicians and support staff bridge the gap between how patient data is represented and stored in a new Epic implementation versus a legacy EHR is absolutely vital. Even when a new healthcare technology provides far more value and improved user experience by offering up cool dashboards and leveraging discrete data to model trends and support clinical decision support, knowing how more simple data sets and standards are supported (such as image-based documents/reports) and displayed is just as important. If they weren’t important, then they wouldn’t be included in the patient record (since we already determined above whether an interface or data source was worth converting).
When data standards don’t fall into line with the latest and greatest, there may very well still be tremendous value in the payload. But the health system must come up with an efficient way to handle this information, normalize it whenever possible, and serve it up to physicians in a way that drives care forward and underlines the very impetus for healthcare data conversion efforts in the first place.

Cures Act - Provider Solutions
The 21st Century Cures Act (“Cures Act”) was passed by Congress and signed into law in December 2016. The bill authorized $6.3 Billion in funding to be directed primarily to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for a handful of different initiatives around population health.
The ONC Final Ruling is primarily about patient electronic access to their health data. While this is the main goal, the ruling also supports provider needs on clinical data sharing, as well as addressing industry-wide information blocking practices that have often been stipulated by EHR providers.
What it means for Healthcare Providers?
Healthcare Providers will see new challenges in three areas:
Improving Quality of Care
Use of data for value-based payment programs
HIT certification for medical and pediatric specialties
Easy sharing and access to data. Focus on data privacy and security
Reporting of clinical data for administrative purposes
Improving Patient Access
Secure access for their updated electronic health records remotely
Policies to facilitate patient communication with the hospital information system
Certification & development of patient-centric EHR
Information Blocking
Penalties for provider/health information exchange engaged in information blocking
Restrict authorized access, exchange, use of electronic health information and transition between certified EHR systems
314e’s 21st Century Cures Act solutions can help you with customized solutions built on top of its state-of-the-art
Muspell CDR
that integrate with your existing IT system so you are ready to face these challenges. Here is how 314e can help you in each challenge area:
Challenge: Conditions of Participation
All Hospitals will be required to send Admission, Discharge, and Transfer (ADT) messages to other providers involved in patient’s care. The goal is to provide improved care coordination across providers and enable other providers to reach out to patient’s post-discharge to ensure that their follow-up care is properly implemented.
Key data elements required would be Admission, Discharge and Transfer (ADT) Information.

Optimization & Upgrades
314e’s team of EHR optimization & upgrades experts has significant experience in staffing and running Epic EHR optimization and upgrade projects. Our approach allows the already thinly stretched customer management team to focus their time and effort on other projects that require their attention.
Epic EHR Optimization & Upgrades
From experience, we understand the structure of Epic’s upgrade project planning and the tight timeline adherence required to meet the agreed-upon schedule. We partner with our clients to ensure strategy, staffing, testing and training are aligned with Epic’s approach.
Our consultants bring experience and knowledge to upgrade projects as they are familiar with the enhancements in new version build and application capabilities. Bringing prior upgrade support experience can simplify the impact to those identified key variances in workflow.
We carefully adhere to the Epic recruiting guidelines and frequently sends consultants to Epic headquarters to expand their Epic product certifications and remain current on Epic implementation methodology, tool sets, best practices and system upgrade strategies.
Epic Optimization
314e’s Epic optimization projects have provided major enhancements to business and clinical electronic capabilities for our clients. Our optimization project experience encompasses ancillary, clinical, patient access and revenue cycle functionality. 314e’s consultant team has supported project work in areas of physician personalization and adoption, pathways and workflow integration, revenue cycle and general system enhancement support.
Our clients have identified optimization project support needs based on prioritization of system requests and application enhancements for those functions originally out of scope for their initial go-live. 314e is provides support for advanced build capabilities often requiring experienced build not usually obtained by foundation implementations.
314e understands identifying project work in areas of improved workflows, improved productivity, data analytics, compliance and eventual ROI on your investment. Our consultants have provided direct support on Epic Stars and Honor Roll programs as well as direct oversight and support for Epic Connect affiliate and acquired facilities. We also provide specialty-specific support for clinical focused projects that address concerns of physician burnout and/or retention of resources.
Successful optimization projects consider cross-departmental improvements and overall expansion of application functionality. While our consultants understand optimization projects as system enhancements, workflow improvements and module functionality being primary drivers, 314e consultants add value by also providing:

As part of the Trump Administration’s MyHealthEData initiative, this final rule is focused on driving interoperability and patient access to health information by liberating patient data using CMS authority to regulate Medicare Advantage (MA), Medicaid, CHIP, and Qualified Health Plan (QHP) issuers on the Federally-facilitated Exchanges (FFEs). CMS recently introduced new interoperability mandates for health plans (MA organizations, Medicaid FFS
programs, CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, and CHIP managed care entities) based on the regulations of the Cures Act that must be implemented by July 1, 2021.
What it means for Payers?
Payers, or insurance companies, need to focus on two key challenge areas:
Patient Access
Implement and maintain a secure, standards-based Patient Access API (using Health Level 7
®
(HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources
®
(FHIR) 4.0.1) that allows patients to easily access their claims and encounter information
Data Interoperability
Make the provider directory information available via the “Provider Directory API” using a public-facing digital endpoint on the payer’s website
Part D Medicare Advantage plans must also make formulary information available via the Patient Access API
Payer to Payer Data Exchange to share claims and clinical data using the FHIR
®
R4 standard

The Role of EMPI Services in Data Conversation for Health Information
October 23, 2020
314e Employee
Interoperability
When it comes to
data conversion for health information (PHI)
, there are many aspects to consider to ensure that the transition from a legacy system to a new EHR system is as smooth as possible, with as few gaps as feasible. One key area regarding data conversion and ingestion into Epic EHR, for example, is fine tuning the EMPI service. An Enterprise Master Patient Index (EMPI) is basically the bouncer between interoperable and integrated healthcare technologies that ensures each patient is represented comprehensively, once, and that fake IDs aren’t allowed to pass through. Making sure that Patient X continues to be represented as Patient X in a new system (and not Patient XX, for example) will allow for a myriad of archiving and
interface opportunities (including HIEs)
in the future by maintaining the fidelity of the patient record across the care continuum.
Let’s consider a few more aspects of an EMPI that contribute toward a solid data conversion process for Epic implementation.
Automation First, Human Intervention Last
The data points that identify a single patient across care settings and throughout various EHR systems are varied and reliable. Some metrics rarely change, such as date of birth and social, which make for certain characteristics that can be used as anchors for automatically identifying a patient as a match (or no match), and therefore kicking off the appropriate process in data conversation (consolidating the record or creating a new record, respectively).
However, other identifiers are subject to change, sometimes quite often, such as:
Address
Last Name
Middle Name (inclusion or exclusion of)
Payor/Policy Information
Phone Number
Having a robust enough EMPI that can handle these scenarios is critical for making the data conversion process as streamlined and efficient as possible, while reducing errors and duplicate patient records. But there is a very important component in this process that can’t be skipped: human intervention. There are decisions that we, as humans, can make that even the best AI in healthcare can’t yet replicate.
Weighted Analysis Of Patient Records For Data Conversion
One of the most critical tasks for establishing an EMPI for an organization or health system is to determine how to analyze patient identifiers in a systematic way that creates consistency, while still giving credence to the human brain to make a judgement call: match or no match. Assigning a weight to certain data elements basically establishes which metrics the entity will treat as more reliable than others, enabling decision points when there’s uncertainty and all other options have been exhausted (such as consulting public records). For example, if a hospital makes the call as part of their data conversion strategy to implement Epic that patient phone number is not a highly reliable identifier, then an MPI Analyst doesn’t have to spend too much time on reviewing records when other, weightier metrics match, such as social security number and insurance policy ID. This creates some level of order to the discretion invoked when people are making the final call to create as few disparate patient records for a unique patient as possible, thus better tapping into all the benefits of discrete data in Epic and its role in making interoperability possible.
The Master Patient ID: Your Golden Ticket For Data Conversion And Interoperability
There’s no shortage of work and analysis that it takes to consolidate patient records accurately, but it’s all worth it when you reach the pinnacle: a single Master Patient ID for a unique patient! Establishing this value makes it possible to gather all the documents and files available to the health system via their Epic EHR and interfaces (including Health Information Exchanges), and to then — most importantly — represent the data as a comprehensive record for the physician to review and act upon. We’ve heard for years that providers would actually prefer
less
information on their patients if it’s not available in a consolidated, efficient presentation. Establishing a stake in the ground as legacy data is converted for a new system to say that Patient X is Patient X (and never Patient XX) is of massive importance, and paves the way for a host of opportunities for the hospital or health system to really flex their healthcare IT muscles around the mighty anchor of Epic.

How We Can Support Fellow Healthcare IT Professionals During COVID-19
October 16, 2020
314e Employee
Staff Augmentation
We’ve shared many tips thus far for facilitating
Epic implementation efforts
in the midst of
the COVID-19 pandemic
Acknowledge The Mask-Wearing Elephant In The Room
One of our biggest pet peeves are the folks who appear to be tone deaf to the incredible burden carried by all healthcare professionals on the front lines of COVID-19, including tech folks. Whether we’re responsible for direct patient care or implementing EHR solutions to support these clinical roles, we’re feeling the impacts of this virus across the entire spectrum of our industry. Sending an email or beginning a meeting without first checking in and acknowledging what someone is (even potentially) going through right now is like a clanging gong. It doesn’t ring as genuine or humane, and it doesn’t open the channels for effective communication with peers who may very well be hanging on by a thread.
We all like to imagine that we’re impervious to stress and fear, capable of doing our jobs without missing a beat, but this is both false and really rough to expect of yourself and each other. Allow a beat, just a brief one, for taking the professional equivalent of a deep breath before launching into business-as-usual.
the perfect time to focus on the most important thing and leave anything else out that can wait. (Think: Essentialism applied to business communications. Less is more.)
Keep Communication With Healthcare IT Pros To-The-Point
While we advocate for keeping the current state of affairs out in the open, this doesn’t have to usurp all communication until further notice. There is an incredible volume of data coming at all of us right now, even more so for those on the front lines of healthcare. Sending a verbose email to a physician end user about an
upcoming Epic upgrade
while they’re tackling endless shifts is not a wise move to encourage retention or attention.
So how to proceed? Get to the point. Fast. Don’t send four paragraphs when one will do. Sure, open the email by wishing them well and thanking them for all their hard work. Then get to the point in as few words as possible, highlighting the most critical sentence for efficiency, and then end it.
The same goes for meetings. Don’t drone on. Take a moment to praise their vital role in the fight against Coronavirus, set the expectations and purpose for the meeting, deliver the content/have the discussion, then disconnect and send action steps in a simple bulleted list to follow. Now is
the perfect time to focus on the most important thing and leave anything else out that can wait. (Think: Essentialism applied to business communications. Less is more.)
Don’t Assume Priorities For Health Systems During COVID-19
Finally, when conducting business with healthcare IT professionals and healthcare providers in the current climate, don’t assume that your project, needs, priorities are the same as those you’re working with. Sure, their clinic or hospital may not be swarming with ICU cases and maxed out ventilator capacity, but a beloved parent may be infected and fighting tooth and nail for breath. We have both individual and collective battles to fight right now, so it’s important to ask and get a sense of where your audience and colleagues are in regard to the subject at hand.
For example, if you’re moderating a scheduled conference call for the Epic implementation project team, start by checking in with key stakeholders on their ability to stay involved, to provide budget for efforts, and to execute against whatever plans existed before Coronavirus upended more than just the project.
Better Together
We will all make it through this time if we support one another by remembering we’re more than just resources or end users on a project. Show up well for one another and we can do far greater things.

EHR Interfaces
314e understands that interoperability and EHR interfaces in healthcare are
complex. Whether you are implementing Epic, Cerner or any other EHR system,
our interface implementation professionals apply an in-depth understanding of
how various EHRs and their interface applications work to provide you with
exceptional value and quality in all aspects of integration.

Data Conversion & Archival
Switching to a new EHR system is a daunting process, including data conversion & archival from your legacy systems. 314e’s skilled resources can handle your data conversion effort, allowing for you to focus on other areas of your implementation.
314e has supported
over 20 data conversion & archival projects
converting data from
more than 30 different legacy systems
to Epic by loading HL7v2 messages into Epic Bridges, loading CCDs via Patient Abstractor or importing flat file data directly into Chronicles.
Commanding expertise in programming, database management and interoperability standards such as HL7 v2 and CCD, our database professionals write code to extract data from your legacy EMR, transform it to HL7 v2, CCD, CSV flat file, or any other custom format you would like and load it into your new EHR system. All along the process, they engage with your IT team and clinical users to validate the converted data along with all translations and formatting.
Data types migrated
Demographics
Encounters
Lab Orders and Results
Imaging Orders and Results
Procedures
Vitals
Notes and Transcripts
Scans and other Documents
Billing Charges
Medical Summaries
Provider Data
Problems
Allergies
Medications
Immunizations
In addition to converting for EHRs, our professionals have experience converting for archival systems. Our resources will extract and convert your historical clinical data to the format required by your archival system, and work with you to test and validate the archived data.
We are currently developing a custom archival solution that can supplement your data conversion effort to archive your historical data into Google Cloud using the state-of-the-art FHIR standard, allowing your programmers and reporters easy access to data via simple RESTful queries. Our app will provide an intuitive clinical data viewer which would give seamless access to past and present clinical data to your users, enabling them to make well-informed decisions for patient care.
Our EHR Data Migration Expertise
314e’s data conversion & archival team are experts in migrating data from wide variety of EMRs which includes both clinical and administrative data. We have experience with the following EHRs and many more.

Business Intelligence (BI)
314e’s healthcare business intelligence (BI) practice employs industry best data governance practices to empower your organization to leverage data to its fullest potential.
The US healthcare system is experiencing a lot of change as patient care models are shifting from fee-for-service to fee-for-value. The impact of the healthcare reform and emerging models of care delivery is the creation of an enormous amount of data in EHRs and ancillary systems. Healthcare organizations need to look at aggregating clinical, financial, operational and non-traditional data captured, both internal and external to their information systems, to enable data-driven decisions in their practices to positively impact the lives of their patients.
314e implements comprehensive healthcare analytics solutions to provide the best approach to business intelligence and creative self-service BI capabilities to support a wide range of business requests. We pride ourselves in offering solutions that are self-governing and address the needs of business users and bring together people, processes, technology and culture.

About 314e Name
3.14 is an abbreviation for the very special number Pi (π) – the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter. The ubiquitous nature of π makes it one of the most widely known mathematical constants, both inside and outside the scientific community. ‘e’ is another symbol that shows up in unexpected places in life and mathematics as the base of the natural logarithm. So, how is the 314e name connected to healthcare IT?
3.14e (Pi) shares many of the same characteristics and qualities that are needed to successful deliver healthcare IT solutions: precision, never ending, connected and productive. We believe that our company name is a great way  to represent our passion for our healthcare clients and the patients that they serve.
By the way…March 14th (Pi Day) has become a special day for us here at 314e. In fact, we celebrate this special day at 12:14 PDT (3:14 EDT) on 3/14 with a company party consisting of Pizza and Pi(e)!
We’re Global
314e is headquartered in the Silicon Valley with regional offices in Philadelphia and in Bangalore, India.

We are thankful for the opportunity to serve our clients.
“314e provided us with several difficult to find consultants for our Epic implementation who worked well with our team. They are always helpful, responsive and effective.”
Barbara Johnson
Director - Information Services
Rockford Health System
“Over the 8 months 314e has provided over 130 At-the-Elbow support resources throughout our last four Go-Live Waves. We plan to continue utilizing their support for our fifth and final wave this February.”
Ellen Pollack
Chief Nursing Informatics Officer UCLA Health
“At Reading Health System, we used 314e to assist us with our Epic implementation. 314e consultants did a high quality job on numerous aspects of the project including planning, workflow analysis, configuration, training, integration and reporting. They also did a fantastic job of assisting us with Go-Live support where they provided close to 100 at-the-elbow support staff for our Epic Go-Lives in both the Inpatient and Ambulatory settings.”
Saravana Govindasamy
Program Manager for PMO Reading Health System
“314e has provided consulting resources on the technical side of the Epic install including desktop support, end user device specialists, SharePoint developers, database architects and technical and infrastructure project managers. 314e has been a trusted and integral partner in the success of our Epic project.”
Lee Herrmann
Chief Healthcare Technology Officer
Santa Clara Valley Health & Hospital System
“314e has been a tremendous help to our organization with their strong Caché background, overall skill set, and a great attitude. The resources we have in place are a wonderful addition to our team, particularly when it comes to development efforts around Ensemble interface engine and training.”
Michael Day
VP - Information Technology Verity Health System
“314e provided us with services to fully implement our Epic data warehouse, advance our analytics infrastructure, and develop sophisticated business intelligence content to make us more competitive in the marketplace.”
Dov Marocco
Chief Innovation & Improvement Officer Santa Clara Valley Health & Hospital System
KLAS 314e Client Testimonials
“The quality of work from 314e is very good. The consultant we use really thinks things through. He doesn’t make major mistakes and understands the whole picture. He views things holistically; developing that skill can be difficult. We appreciate his view on tackling projects. As far as content and due diligence, the level of performance has been great for us. Our consultant has managed our staff to make sure they get things done on time. There is always a delay with IT work, and he is always following up to make sure we are as close to being on time as we can be. I am satisfied with him. We have extended him at our facility multiple times. I don’t see a lot of room for improvement.”
Director / Physician
“314e consistently hits deadlines. When they miss deadlines, I don’t blame them because we either didn’t give them the things we needed up front or changed the requirements on them. We did a lot of things like that, and 314e rolled with it and still delivered what we needed. I get our money’s worth and then some because their CEO works with me to make sure I get the value I perceived in using 314e. As long as I have money, I will continue to use 314e.”
Manager / Analyst
“I invested in 314e because they had the best and deepest business model for what I was looking for. They are really good business partners. I chose them because they had the ability to throw warm bodies at me to accomplish almost anything I needed. I don’t have to go out and find people myself because 314e has a deep bench of people who are on salary. That helps me know 314e is always going to have people at my disposal when I need them. 314e is not like other vendors who tell me they can do something but have to go out and build a team. 314e built their team for the long term, and that is one of the things I appreciate about them.”
Manager / Analyst
“I keep going back to 314e because I believe in their product. Also, they have been great business partners. I like that Abhishek Begerhotta, 314e’s CEO, works with me and negotiates with me. I like 314e’s leadership team a lot. We have a great working relationship. The executive involvement is very strong. The executives are hands off when they need to be hands off and hands on when they need to be hands on.”
Manager / Analyst
“I feel that 314e has an excellent understanding of Epic’s implementation processes. Their consultants are very technical and knowledgeable regarding how to implement Epic’s system in a way that suits our needs. We are very happy with our decision to recruit 314e. We will definitely consider 314e for our future needs.”

5 Tips to Excel as a Healthcare IT Consultant in COVID times
October 9, 2020
314e Employee
Staff Augmentation
Now more than ever, many healthcare IT professionals are finding unconventional avenues for work. In particular, the current era of social distancing has resulted in a rise in remote work, encouraging many folks to operate for the first time as freelance consultants. On-prem requirements are loosened and health organizations are realizing just how few jobs really need to be done on site or even by a fully employed resource. Many employers that are finding creative ways to innovate their workforce are simultaneously turning to freelancers and contractors to carry out their
EHR implementations
and other critical functions. So how can a health IT consultant excel to stay competitive and pave for themselves a strong career path? We have a few ideas!
Keep In Touch With Healthcare IT Trends
This should go without saying, but you’d be surprised how many folks don’t heed the obvious. Healthcare IT trends don’t typically shift too drastically, but the solutions available certainly change often given the innovation in this space. Not to mention, most of us didn’t see a global health pandemic coming, but life happens and so hospitals and health organizations must pivot in response. Touching base with practicing healthcare providers, vendors, and clinical staff is a great way to get input from the frontlines, not to mention critical feedback that may be leveraged to improve software and implementation processes supported down the road.
Especially between engagements or as healthcare IT consultants bounce between focuses, subscribing to
health technology blogs
and staying plugged in to resources like LinkedIn can maintain a fresh perspective. The best way to serve future clients and hospitals is to ensure an understanding of current needs and trends to differentiate oneself in the hiring process, as well as elicit confidence in task execution.
Get your Scrubs On
Specialized training like Epic certification and PMP certification or any other product training and certification is great to bolster a resume and establish a defined knowledge base, but some of the best healthcare consultants we’ve worked with excel because they’ve been there…literally. Spending some time in scrubs can go a long way in directly informing a contractor with an understanding of how technology serves hospital physicians and clinical staff, what challenges they face in providing patient care or running their organization from an administrative perspective, and the nitty gritty of implementing healthcare solutions in a complex, secure environment.
While it may not be ideal (especially right now) to jump into direct patient care, that doesn’t preclude the ability of a consultant to engage with contacts to interview them for feedback or even arrange to shadow a “day in the life” for a deeper understanding of the industry.
Treat Every Interaction As Client Engagement
The freelance life is often romanticized with visions of working from fancy coffee shops or even poolside…which is entirely possible, we won’t deny. But the reality is that healthcare IT consultants wake up every day unemployed when between contracts/engagements. This means consultants must be motivated to generate ongoing contacts and potential streams of revenue and job leads. And the best way to do this: treat every interaction with someone in the healthcare world as a client engagement opportunity. You never know when chit chatting with clinical end users or the project team members during an EHR implementation can turn into long-term contacts that eventually land you additional work, either for the same client or an entirely new path. (Remember: there’s a lot of turnover in healthcare, so never think of relationships as fixed…including your own.)
Dive Into The Health IT Team Like It’s Your Own
The quickest way to avoid positioning oneself as an outsider is to behave like an insider. We’re not advocating for happy hour invites day one or acting like a know-it-all about the organization you’re serving. In fact, this is a paradoxical relationship because the more questions asked and the more enthusiasm for accepting tasks up for grabs, the quicker that a contractor can demonstrate a willingness to learn and adapt that will be well received. Sure, there is resistance at times to a new face on the team. But this can often be overcome when naysayers observe a full-steam-ahead attitude that gets the job done and ultimately demonstrates enough confidence and expertise to say, “I don’t know…tell me more.”
In the absence of cultivated soft skills, consultants can demonstrate a team player attitude by asking thoughtful questions, truly listening to everyone, and considering any task an opportunity to learn more and add value. No one is above rolling up their sleeves to contribute to the team, and every need is a chance to learn more and build both breadth and depth of experience.
Become A Consultant In Demand For Health Systems
Given the interconnectedness of modern health systems in pursuit of
interoperability and strong technical integrations
, showing up strong as a healthcare IT consultant is job security. Work is never promised, but that’s true to traditional full-time employment as well. Keeping a keen eye on providing value and delivering excellent customer service will properly orient consultants to maximize opportunity and secure future contracts without breaking a sweat.

Resource Quality
Our recruiting team of over 30 recruiters is much more than a resume source; they act as advisors to the candidates. They are trained relationship-builders with an in-depth understanding of healthcare, and are functionally and technically informed to screen the best talent.
We have access to over 50,000 qualified individuals with health IT skills and certifications in our internal talent database and through LinkedIn groups that we operate and manage.

We rate candidates on a scale of 1-5, based on their healthcare IT skills, communication, certifications and references.
Before hiring an employee, we go through several steps to ensure that we are hiring the right resource, so that our customers get the maximum benefit from their skills and experience. The steps involve an in-depth recruiter interview (in-person or video interview when possible) to assess communication, cultural fit and basic fit to the job, followed by one or more subject matter expert interviews to assess technical skills.
We also conduct extensive background screening, certification validations, education and experience verification to make sure we present top quality talent to our customers.
Prompt Service
We pride ourselves on our agility and speed to delivery. We shorten hiring timeline through our industry-leading technologies, methodologies and processes. Our quality team’s relentless focus on optimizing business processes and improving service delivery levels enables 314e to consistently exceed our clients’ expectations.

Our services include contract, contract-to-hire, direct-hire, part-time, remote, on-call and turnkey project based solutions. We partner with each client to uncover their unique challenges, accurately identify the number and type of resources needed, and structure contract provisions to perfectly match their requirements.

314e Corporation launches “Speki” EHR Help
October 6, 2020
314e Employee
News
Pleasanton, Sep 28, 2020 – 314e Corporation, a leader in Healthcare IT products & solutions, announced today the launch of its state-of-the-art EHR Help product “Speki”. Speki embeds the access to training assistance directly within the EHR user interface (using SMART
®
on FHIR
®
), making EHR help available when and where your end-users need it the most.
Alok Sharma, 314e’s COO cited that the real use-case is simple yet meaningful. “Say your provider is in the middle of placing a lab order in the EHR but doesn’t necessarily remember the sequence of actions. Earlier, the provider would have to leave the current EHR screen, go to the help library, search for the right help resource and find the step where they got stuck. With Speki, all they do is click the Speki button on the EHR to access specific information about how to accomplish the task at hand, without ever leaving the EHR.”
Alok summarized Speki in one sentence, “Think of Speki as your at-the-elbow support, that never goes away!”.
Speki is a secure, cloud-based platform, with a high-quality full-text search engine combined with video streaming that provides a modern, world-class help experience for EHR users. Without leaving the flow of work, EHR users will have access to an entire library of micro-learning videos, tip sheets, and other documents to support their effective use of the EHR. Speki provides that information in a way that ensures that the right answer is only 3 clicks away.
314e’s CEO Abhishek Begerhotta said, “We are very excited to launch Speki which we believe will be a game-changer by providing on-demand EHR Help. As EHRs become more complex, two problems come to the fore for your health system. There is a strong business need to control training costs and reduce the training time in the classroom. At the same time, clinicians and medical staff need answers about EHR functionality related issues in real-time. It is not practical that they raise a ticket to the help desk and wait for a response. Speki solves both these issues.”
“314e plans to integrate Speki with a variety of popular EHR systems like Epic, Cerner, eClinicalWorks etc.”

Interoperability For The 21st Century Cures Act Era
October 2, 2020
314e Employee
Interoperability
Healthcare IT circles have been focused on interoperability for decades now. As EHRs like Epic have become ubiquitous within health systems, the next horizon is always how to best share and exchange PHI with other organizations to better manage patient care and ensure HIPAA compliance. With the passage of the
ONC’s 21st Century Cures Act
, the focus has shifted to finally overcoming many of the barriers that have lingered in disparate data exchange attempts of the past. In fact, healthcare providers and hospitals are now on the hook (via a certification program) to comply with the
Cures Act Final Rule
Today we’ll highlight a few aspects of the 21st Century Cures Act to help shed light on how these efforts move us toward real interoperability in healthcare.
Discrete Data Prized Over Document Overload In True EHR Interoperability
Many answered the call for data exchange among healthcare providers by delivering read-only documents (generally PDFs) to other physicians. In many cases, they resided in the EHR, but they were barely a step up from the fax machine model (and in some cases, more clunky to retrieve than a hard copy in hand). In addition to being a subpar user experience, the reliance on verbose documents as continuity of care tools places even more strain on the already packed schedules of doctors. Two choices were available: skim the document and potentially miss vital information, or read the document thoroughly and chronically run 20-minutes behind schedule. Neither supports the current care delivery realities, so it’s a choice between bad and, well, also bad.
However, interoperability efforts that prioritize discrete data for exchange, parsing relevant data points to their logical place in the EHRs or HIE connected, at long last start to deliver value and efficiency. Instead of rifling through pages of notes, all in various formats or standards, the problems list includes all known problems, the medications list is comprehensive, and it’s no mystery where the patient has been when. Solutions like
314e’s
Muspell
make delivering ADT (Admission, Discharge, Transfer) information, as a current challenge example, via interoperability standards a reality for health systems, improving visibility to patient activity and encouraging better clinical outcomes in the process (which is really the whole point of the Cures Act).
Have API, Will Exchange Data
Because compliance to interoperability standards such as FHIR (which we’ll discuss more in a moment) are still hit and miss, the ability for health organizations to expose a well-constructed API to make PHI and care information readily available to connecting entities and support community-wide interoperability is necessary. There will inevitably be a few providers in a given area that simply don’t have the budget or bandwidth (or even the pressing need, to be fair) to go full blown HL7 in terms of data standards, especially if they’re using a “homegrown” health technology solution. But leveraging an IT partner to develop suitable APIs can support the development of a cultivated, patient-centric record that includes at least a base set of data from across care providers.
The Push To Adopt HL7 Standards Is Getting Real
We could argue that much of the yet-to-be-realized value of interoperability that persists in the market is because there is still too much variation in payload formats and not as much buy-in to leverage HL7 standards. However, the 21st Century Cures Act gives full-scale interoperability a fighting chance by placing more emphasis (and pressure, really) on healthcare systems to adopt FHIR standards for data exchange. Not only does this greatly simplify implementations and exchanges, but it allows for scalability at a rapid pace, which is all the more relevant today, having experienced an unexpected global pandemic. We need data, and we need it now. Expecting and adhering to HL7 FHIR standards is the new normal, as the very nature of the Act is to prevent blockers from obtaining records (by physicians
and
patients) and exchanging electronic PHI.
Adopting FHIR data exchange standards is a key way that hospitals can position themselves to be major players in their respective care community, as well as positively influence the push toward comprehensive care records and clinical care transparency as envisioned in the 21st Century Cures Act.
314e’s Cures Act experts will be happy to have a conversation with you to understand more about your needs and provide the most suitable solution.

3 Reasons For Hospitals To Hire A Certified Epic Trainer
September 25, 2020
314e Employee
EHR Services
There is no doubt that some of the best resources available to support hospitals and health systems implementing Epic is their own staff. Knowing the ins-and-outs of a given organization provides incredible insight and expertise that any healthcare IT initiative would be foolish to pass up. Use case requirements are far more salient and impactful when considering local needs and unique initiatives of a given care community. Now, imagine the exponential power of augmenting an EHR implementation team with external SMEs to develop solutions that address past, present, and future clinical and administrative needs! Bringing in
certified Epic trainers
, for example, is an ideal strategy to not only fulfill the instructional requirement for end users for a new or upgraded EHR, but to also incorporate a more holistic perspective of use cases and technical opportunities. Aligning local experts with industry experts is a recipe for successful Epic adoption and real traction for long-term organizational growth.
Let’s look at three key ways that bringing in Certified Epic Trainers can benefit hospitals as they roll out EHR implementations, upgrades, and optimizations.
One observation we have from working with hundreds of clients is that on-staff Epic Super Users and those tapped for Train-the-Trainer deployments during the implementation process can drive facility-specific use cases and workflows like no other. However, there can at times be a degree of shortsightedness for all the potential opportunities for optimizing existing workflows to better capture discrete data, support interoperability, or any other initiatives that may build upon day-to-day patient care. This is where bringing in an outside perspective of a Certified Epic Trainer can help address the point-of-care training points while also helping to broaden horizons for getting the most benefit from an EHR solution like Epic.
Another benefit to hiring experienced trainers (versus clinical-staff-cum-instructors) is that not only do hospitals get Epic-centric best practices, but also adult learning best practices as part of their instructional methods.
Adult Learning Theory
explains that adults obtain information and engage very differently than children (given we often equate and develop learning environments with traditional school as our primary anchor point). Cultivating readiness for Epic training as well as conveying purpose, concrete applications, and incentives for participation are paramount, for example, and this requires time and focus that busy Super Users may not have the bandwidth to support.
Epic Certified Trainers also have tremendous experience with various instructional delivery methods, from classroom settings to
digital learning applications for EHR training
The last reason we’ll mention for bringing in professional Epic training resources is that experienced instructors can leverage the most innovative tools for reaching busy clinical end users in a variety of methods to best drive attendance, participation, and ultimately retention. Training is a vital precursor to the
Epic Go-Live phase
, so ensuring that there are several modes of instruction available — such as traditional classroom and on-demand digital modules — to best meet the needs and abilities of all hospital staff and clinicians will go a long way in driving adoption and optimal use of the EHR.
Epic trainers can develop and maintain the training environment and materials to ensure the most up-to-date information is available, and that users can easily access (and re-access, importantly) the content throughout the EHR’s ever-evolving lifecycle. This is also key for supporting organizational turn-over and sustaining scale and growth, especially as health systems grow and acquire new facilities/practices.

3 Common Mistakes in Epic Training
September 11, 2020
314e Employee
EHR Services
Hospital project teams that are tasked with implementing Epic EHR have no shortage of important steps to manage. Training is the pinnacle of these efforts. When handled well, training can set the stage for empowered users and the promised ROI for administrators. However, we unfortunately see a lot of repeat mistakes when it comes to
Epic training for hospitals
A crucial aspect of creating great Epic training materials is to bear in mind the audience: busy clinical end users. With this in mind, we’ve seen hospitals and health systems opt for hefty training guides and videos that don’t allow for easy access to information that will help clinicians make use of their EHR in an efficient manner. Following adult learning best practices and creating brief training modules — be it videos under five-minutes, or quick start guides — hospitals will encourage better participation and retention of the content.
Best Practice Tip
We are accustomed to a different kind of media these days, and it’s important to incorporate this into the training suite used for
Epic implementation
to better reach the full audience of users. Administrative staff (such as intake/front office professionals) may adore their training packets (physical copies of workflow steps) or quick start guides, while physicians may prefer videos that they can quickly digest between patients or whenever their schedules allow. Developing both physical and digital resources for Epic training will allow trainers to better serve all expected users, ultimately encouraging adoption and ROI realization.
Creating dynamic, multi-media training content to support EHR training is great, but if they’re never maintained or accounting for
upgrades and optimizations
to Epic, even the best resources will fail to drive results. Time is valuable to end users, and if they quickly identify outdated  information or workflows in the training guides or training videos, they’ll likely be unwilling to continue and re-engage if/when updates are made. Honor the time of busy hospital providers by keeping materials fresh and allowing budget for periodic reviews for accuracy and successful engagement.
Best Practice Tip
As many hospitals engage professional Epic trainers to handle their go-live, the task of following up on training initiatives may get lost in the shuffle if not properly assigned to someone within the hospital to own. Even if the decision is made to outsource the on-going maintenance and creation of testing materials, it’s important someone within the health system has it on their radar (or literal calendars) to periodically evaluate the need for a refresh or update. Don’t wait for end users to tell you that the content is stale.
One last mistake of note often comes from health systems that go all-in on their initial launch of Epic, but fail to account for on-going needs…especially when it comes to training. You may get everyone trained, logged in, and using the technology, but what happens when the inevitable turn-over hits and new users need training? What if a physician has been on leave and needs a refresher upon their return to dive back in to handle their patient load? What happens when support staff need to review less-frequently-utilized workflows or modules to drive preferred processes? These scenarios are going to be tough to address with physical classroom training sessions as the lone option.
Best Practice Tip
Digital learning
for Epic training is a great solution to account for these needs, as it capitalizes on reproducible, on-demand training materials that can be easily scaled, reviewed and updated as needed. This successful approach also introduces the opportunity for quizzing participants to measure mastery and retention, as well as feedback to improve future training endeavors to best serve the end users (In fact, if we had to add a fourth common mistake, it would be
not
incorporating user feedback directly into the training program).
314e works with dozens of health systems and helps them deliver great Epic training. Our training programs can be onsite or online. Talk to us today for a customized training program that fits your needs!

The Power of Data Science in Healthcare to Drive Advanced Analytics
September 18, 2020
314e Employee
Data Analytics
In an era when data is everything, finding ways to cultivate and drive analytics is a priority in nearly every industry. Healthcare is certainly no exception, especially in light of recent events. Where some healthcare organizations perform better than others, in this realm, is largely dependent on how aggressively health systems pursue integration, aggregation and analysis of structured and unstructured data that may not be readily available straight out of their EHR. Incorporating
data science for healthcare
use cases is a perfect application of cutting edge technology and thought leadership to derive analytics that tell us more than we ever imagined we could know about our care communities, physician behaviors, disease patterns, our patients and much more.
What Exactly is Data Science
Many hospital executives are familiar with the concept of AI, both in the general applications of modern life and in select use cases already widely available to healthcare facilities today. However, they’re less likely to have encountered data science for health applications. AI may be a byproduct of a data science engagement depending on the clinical use case, but the discipline is not limited to robotic outputs, so to speak. While it may sound intimidating,
data scientists
are essentially trained professionals who understand how to compile and organize tremendous amounts of data of all types, and develop algorithms or data models to put that information to good use. In a nutshell, they speak data fluently and can translate to whatever language is needed, serving it up in whatever way makes sense.
Healthcare Data Science Goes Beyond the EHR
One of the first opportunities available to hospitals that tap data scientists for clinical use cases is identifying data elements that may be just out of reach given existing healthcare IT solutions, but are nevertheless capable of driving incredibly powerful data models and visualizations to manage patient care or clinical outcomes, among other things. Most of us in the healthcare space are so used to thinking in terms of a fixed set of data — largely that which we know we get from EHRs like Epic or even from interoperability solutions like an HIE — whereas data scientists are apt to search outside these solutions and come up with creative ways to mine for deep data. These pros aren’t going to run from messy, unstructured data or the lack of an easily-identifiable way to extract the information. They’re trained to come up with solutions to aggregate info and then run with open-source tools to get what they want.
Data Science Use Cases: You Define the What, They Define the How
It’s a beautiful thing to simply articulate a need and allow someone else to come up with the method for making it happen. Too often, health system administrators feel they are limited in terms of what information they can gather and work from, and so they don’t ask for more. By leveraging data science for hospitals, the possibilities expand and really intriguing questions can be asked (and answered) of the full data set that is out there, even if untapped and unrecognized. Developing use cases and analytics-of-interest can shape the type of metrics that data scientists can (at the very least attempt) to track down and bring into the data model, or in the absence of an effective mechanism to capture and extract needed information, come up with an algorithm to “learn” what needs to be extrapolated to drive results.
Go Beyond Dashboards with Data Science for Healthcare
We are far too willing to accept what is already developed and “on the shelf” when it comes to analytics for hospital systems. Embracing data science means that large hospital networks can craft visualizations and predictive models for their care community in ways that are uniquely beneficial and impactful for their needs and desires. There is no shortage of things we want to know and understand to better facilitate the care of patients and the ability of providers to manage that care, and data science for healthcare brings great promise for revolutionizing the industry for the better.

How to Create Healthy EHR Interfaces
September 2, 2020
314e Employee
Interoperability
One of the key benefits to hospitals for investing in a robust EHR like Epic is to not only cultivate their own breadth and depth of patient data, but also to set the foundation for augmenting that data set via
EHR interfaces
Here are the top three mistakes to avoid when building your EHR interface:
1. Not vetting the quality of incoming data before it arrives
As they say: garbage in, garbage out. If the quality or reliability of data coming in via an interface isn’t good, it doesn’t matter how promptly you’re getting those messages (and associated documentation). Especially for health systems that have carefully managed the
data conversation
process when implementing their Epic instance, maintaining expectations around the cleanliness of ePHI is paramount.
If a healthcare entity can’t vouch for, or meet certain requirements around their outbound interface, it’s worth waiting for the right resources and commitment to quality before making that connection happen. This may mean hiring outside developers/contractors who are familiar with less-common data standards or who have dealt with “massaging” data in transit to reduce clutter in the destination system. More isn’t necessarily better when it comes to patient data, especially if it mucks up the eMPI and junks up the point-of-care experience.
2. Not testing rigorously
We’ve shared earlier how important it is to leverage
professional testers for healthcare IT interoperability
, and this is an absolute linchpin when it comes to building interfaces to an Epic instance. Not only do you need technical QA to validate payloads of interface messages and keep an eye on the queue for errors, but hospitals should also leverage clinical testers to review the patient data within the care record to ensure fidelity of incoming data and where it resides within Epic.
Getting the information is great, but if it’s not in the right place and normalized to the right format, it can cause more harm than help – ask any busy physician!
So, test, test and test again!
3. Not bringing in an experienced Project Manager to corral EHR interface vendors
Most hospital administrators we know don’t have the time to constantly chase down vendors and drive the level of responsiveness required to get interfaces up and running, especially if they’re less than turnkey (i.e. an outdated or “home-grown” standard). Bringing in a seasoned Technical Project Manager is a great way to alleviate the internal burden of implementing a new Epic interface while still maintaining quality deliverables with timeline and budget intact. In fact, we’ve often seen that dedicated PMs, focused on the task at hand, can often drive completion of EHR implementation projects more effectively than a resource wearing too many (or ill-fitting) hats.
Not to mention, health IT project management brings an expansive view to hospitals implementing solutions for patient care, allowing stakeholders to get as much bang for their proverbial buck as possible. Experience goes a long way in avoiding pitfalls before they can even manifest, as well as nimbly responding to delays or barriers.

Put in the Effort on the Front end to Enjoy Lasting Benefits of Interoperability
Anything worth doing is worth doing right, as they say. Tapping into the most experienced resources isn’t always the cheapest solution on paper, but when considering the lingering costs and absolute frustration of chasing down shoddy technical implementations impacting an EHR, the value is indisputable (and honestly, it’s cheaper in the long-term).
Quality patient care is all the more bolstered when healthy EHR interfaces for health systems are established and maintained.

The Importance of Collaboration for Epic Implementations
August 5, 2020
314e Employee
EHR Services
It’s challenging enough to
implement Epic
for a single facility. Consider, then, the importance of collaboration when implementing Epic across multiple facilities and practices. Sure, the end game is a unified solution that allows for these providers to coordinate care more effectively and communicate efficiently. But in the development process of the integrated EHR system, it’s critical to consider the needs of the whole — meaning every clinical end user and department who will be using the shared health record, across specialties and facilities — to ensure that decisions made don’t lead to friction post go-live. Today we’ll share a few aspects of this collaboration that are worth thinking through before Epic implementation efforts kick-off.
Epic Workflows Need Buy-In from Stakeholders at Each Facility…Large and Small
We often see that the largest facilities generally get the most consideration when it comes to workflow development in the Epic implementation process. They represent the most users and generally have the biggest pull in terms of influence, but it’s unwise to simply yield to the majority. There may be smaller facilities that have exceptionally efficient workflows in place, and therefore learning from their best practices and incorporating those into system flows would actually help everyone level up.
Consider Speciality-Specific Working Groups for Workflow Planning
Where ancillary providers share care responsibilities (such as EDs), it’s worth scheduling a working group that can focus on care-specific requirements that will benefit patients, no matter which facility they present. This not only creates a consistent patient experience, but allows for physicians and support staff who may round to multiple locations to have the same general expectations of their workflow and technology. The need for re-training and errors are minimal when proper consideration and communication are employed in the planning stage of implementing an EHR. Any time you can get end users to put their heads together, you’re going to benefit from mindshare in the execution.
Loop in Downstream Practices to Support Long-Term Epic Adoption
Even if a practice or facility is several phases (or even years) away from being on deck for Epic implementation as part of a health system initiative, it’s important to include those stakeholders from the onset. This contributes to the aforementioned benefit of tapping into best practices from the collective experience and minimizing the need for later workflow changes (when future needs are overlooked due to shortsightedness). But the bigger benefit is the sense of buy-in and true partnership that is cultivated when all parties have a seat at the table and a valued voice to use there.
Keep in mind that even the smallest practices can logjam progress and preclude system-wide adoption when their needs aren’t met (or even considered) by new healthcare technology. Because proper
Epic training
and go-live rely on a large measure of cooperation across care settings and resources, it pays off to pave a smooth path by inviting participation, honoring feedback and considering the collective good at every step.
Coordinated Care Doesn’t Occur Without Coordination
We fully realize that Epic implementation project teams can’t please everyone, and it’s just as important for Project Managers to hold their ground when participants try to hijack the initiative and threaten the collective desire to unify providers via an integrated EHR. However, creating an attitude of receptivity and value for all the quirks and kinks that come with disparate practices coming together for a common goal will yield far greater success than trying to force a one-size-fits-all approach. There’s much to be gained by learning from one another and leveraging the best of the best to create connected care communities that can change the healthcare experience.

What is the Role of a Project Manager in EHR Implementation?
July 29, 2020
314e Employee
EHR Services
Implementing an EHR like Epic for a large health system is a hefty task, and there are many specialized players involved to make it happen. One of the key roles is the Project Manager. Depending on the size of the team, PMs can wear many hats in the course of supporting the EHR project team. But there are a few key tasks that are the responsibility of the PM in order to execute well and on time. We’ll look at a few specific responsibilities that shape the role of the Project Manager in
EHR implementation projects
, and speak to the importance of this position and the person who fills it.
Vendor Coordination for Epic Implementation
While there is generally an Account Manager or PM from the EHR vendor assigned to a given implementation, there are typically more than just the vendor and hospital involved. Network vendors, third-party apps, HIEs and more will require coordination and consideration to ensure that the health system can continue to get the data expected to care for their patients. The Project Manager assigned to the overall EHR implementation project will be the centralized source of information and collaboration to account for the variables and resources required for full-scale integration.
The implementation PM will maintain a list of contacts, timelines for vendor dependencies, tickets associated with vendor work and more. Given these important tasks, an ideal Epic Project Manager should be:
Able to coordinate teams across companies and skills
Detail oriented
Excellent communicator
Familiar with healthcare IT and the associated technical jargon
Willing to hold people accountable (regardless of title or responsibility)
It’s helpful to think of the PM as the glue that holds the implementation efforts together, uniting them under a shared project plan, timeline and budget.
EHR Implementation and Timeline Management
Speaking of timeline, one of the most challenging tasks with any given project is coming up with a timeline for delivery. Not only does this directly impact the budget (since resources cost money, generally in regard to time spent), but operationally, a health system can’t plan for
Epic go-live and support
without a sense of when the technical aspects will be completed, validated, and ready for training and roll out.
For this reason, a technical project manager for EHR implementation must be able to drive the definition of scope and level of effort to come up with a picture of when each phase of the project will be complete. This generally requires documenting requirements and clarifying roadmap items versus “in scope” deliverables, obtaining estimates from developers and vendors and mapping out the dependencies and expectations in both visual and quantifiable ways for the various stakeholders. Tools like Jira or Microsoft DevOps can be helpful for PMs who are looking to track work based on a backlog of tickets and estimated hours or story points, but even utilizing Smartsheets, Excel or Google Sheets can get the job done. It’s less about the form and more about the function, ensuring everyone on the project has access to critical delivery dates, dependencies and risks.
Project Management’s Role in Problem Solving for Healthcare IT Projects
While some of the best healthcare project managers we’ve worked with wouldn’t necessarily consider themselves technically savvy, it’s important that whoever is at the helm of the EHR implementation has the confidence and professionalism to dig in and address problems as they occur. This requires a combination of soft skills — such as patience, conflict resolution, empathy and creative thinking — and the ability to at least speak the language of healthcare IT well enough to convey and distill information related to facts.
It’s the job of an Epic Project Manager, for example, to call out when a key milestone in the timeline is missed or in jeopardy. The job, of course, isn’t to assign blame, but to raise the concern, press into why it happened, encourage brainstorming to remediate the issue and make it clear who is responsible for what to prevent further delays. In general, the project team owns the solution and execution, but the PM creates the space and sets the tone for how smoothly (or not) that occurs.
Teamwork Makes EHR Integration Possible
It takes a whole team to implement an EHR for hospitals, and while no single role is elevated above others, putting an ill-equipped resource in the seat of Project Manager could have a troubling ripple effect across the entire initiative. When chosen well, however, a good technical PM can unite a given team to accomplish great things…on time.

The Importance of Requirements Management for Epic Implementations
March 4, 2020
314e Employee
EHR Services
Despite the tech savviness of most hospital IT departments, one of the challenges that comes when
implementing Epic EHR
is that there may not be the right resources wearing the right hats (so to speak), to get the job done. We have met many impressive technical resources who are employed by health systems implementing Epic, but knowing how to code and set up a solid network doesn’t equate to having the full skill set to ensure success for the project. A vital aspect of success and user adoption is collecting and documenting comprehensive requirements, not only of the technology itself, but also for supporting clinical workflows and operational needs. Every hospital is different, so grasping the unique requirements for EHR implementation is non-negotiable.
What is the Need and How Does the Implementation of Epic Solve it?
There are undoubtedly reasons for why a health system decides to undertake the complex task of implementing Epic into their care facilities. If those needs and reasons aren’t well communicated, it’s possible that the modules and features required to support that end could be lost in translation. It’s not uncommon that certain aspects of an EHR are favored during the sales process for driving ROI and positively impacting care, but if those very elements aren’t turned into formal functional or technical requirements, they could simply get skipped.
“Where is that dashboard we were promised,”
the COO wants to know. Well, if you don’t put that on the project roadmap to build, it may not get done. And try explaining that to a fuming executive board who just footed the bill for the project.
Maintaining a JIRA project with stories for every requirement is great, but no need for a sophisticated tool to create potential barriers if the
Epic implementation Project Manager
can leverage spreadsheets or even a running document to ensure that someone takes a need and runs with it to the point of formal requirements (or story creation). This is where understanding the operational requirements and technical requirements may well require two (or more) distinct resources, but that the value of each are immeasurable to the overall success of the project.
What Does the End User have to say about their Requirements?
While no one in their right mind would suggest surveying an entire floor of clinicians to gather their list of needs, it is nevertheless wise for Epic Implementation Project Teams to include the actual end users (physicians, nurses, ancillary providers, support staff) in workflow assessments and requirements development. We’ve seen it time and again where hospitals will roll out new technology that fails to take into consideration how clinical staff
actually
work. And while a new EHR can be an opportunity to instigate change for the better and more efficient, it’s often more tone deafness to the actual day-to-day operations of busy clinicians that comes with a new solution. Remember: change is hard, so make the effort worth the payoff.
Don’t Forget to ask the “Little Guys”
Requirements Management is your Epic EHR Compass
Don’t leave requirements management on the back burner as a project nice-to-have. Elevating this role and task to a central figure of the project is a great way to set up the team for delivering a solution that gets used
and praised
! Treat the requirements as your compass, and implementing Epic becomes smooth sailing.

How Training Initiatives Helped Empower and Prepare Baylor Scott & White Health for COVID-19 (Part 3)
April 27, 2020
314e Employee
EHR Services
Part 3 of 3: Jerrie Rankin, VP of Operational Informatics with Baylor Scott & White Health and Nicholas Edwards, Senior Manager Enterprise Technical Training and Support, Baylor Scott & White Health join CHIME Media for a podcast to talk about how training initiatives helped empower and prepare their teams for the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ryan Seratt, Director of Training with 314e chats with Jerrie and Nicholas about this project, as 314e is a partners with their team.
The following is Part 3 of 3 blog posts of the full transcript for our recent CHIME Media podcast.

Epic End Users are the Big Winners
Ryan Seratt:
How about your end users? How are they experiencing your solution?
Nicholas Edwards:
Our end users are really the big winners in all of this. In addition to having access to more training services and materials overall, we’ve reduced our training time spent in the classroom by at least 40%. This means our Doctors, nurses, patient access and other team members now spend less time on-boarding. They’re able to begin impacting patient lives quicker than before. And on the financial side, those hours in training saved equates to millions of dollars in salaries saved each year for an organization of our size.
Another efficiency for end users that was on our u Perform roadmap included integration with Epic. The integration reduces the amount of time end users spend searching for training materials. While this was on our roadmap for later this year, COVID-19 definitely accelerated that roadmap. In collaboration with IS, we were able to fast track this change through our IS governance process and collaborate with the appropriate Citrix team members and Epic analysts, and put a link to COVID-19 training materials and other related information in the Epic patient header. We placed it in the patient header because it’s a centralized place that cannot be modified by end users and every frontline care team member will see it. As a result, our hits to the learning library have risen by 250%, actually over 250%, since putting the button in the patient header.
We include not only Epic tip sheets, but also links to policy changes, care recommendations and links to other websites. It’s really a one stop shop for all things COVID-19 related, and our physicians and nurses have really loved this. As Jerrie mentioned, they no longer have to go searching for an email or try to find an Internet site to get to the information they need. Instead, they can just click on the link during their normal workflow.
In support of our frontline team members, we were able to create approximately 50 unique cross training curricula to support COVID-19, as well. We quickly determined that we need to ensure our training solution would allow for our nursing team members to work in the ICU and ED. Within a day, we had cross training curricula developed for these two areas and this resulted in hundreds of our nursing team members being able to float to these areas. We started with nurses. But as I said, we created approximately 50 curricula that spans nursing, physicians, ancillary and patient access team members. We were able to take existing curricula and create fast track training courses to assist with flexing team members to areas in need of support. We’re still creating more courses as needed. But at this point, we’re able to create an entirely new course in one day in support of our organization’s needs.
Epic Training Within End Users’ Workflows
Ryan Seratt:
Wow, that’s impressive! And do you know how many Epic clients have integrated uPerform and Epic?
Nicholas Edwards:
Now, not to toot my own horn, but we’re amongst the first to do this sort of integration and it’s pretty, pretty cool. Ancile does have a growing healthcare community and they’re in the Epic App Orchard. You know, we were able to lean on our Epic resources and other Ancile community members for advice and for questions. But it does feel pretty cool to be part of a group that’s doing things on the cutting edge of professional learning and development.
Ryan Seratt:
Jerrie, what’s next for Baylor Scott & White Health in the use of uPerform and computer-based training?
Jerrie Rankin:
Well, the future. Yes, we are starting to get very excited about all the potential that we could use this for. Our first plan is to repurpose the COVID-19 button. Hopefully we’ll get to do that sooner rather than later. We’re going live with Storyboard in September. So, we would like to repurpose that because we know that we will want to give people direct access to training. We’re hoping to do that with the Storyboard.
Secondly, we’re going to be collaborating with IS and informatics to kind of determine where we should integrate into Epic, because we know there is a lot of opportunity there. We want to make sure and do that strategically. In fact, placing the COVID-19 button in the patient header has been so successful that we’re now integrating training materials in other areas. So, like I mentioned before, we’re starting with the video visit workflow. Since our providers and patients have been challenged with adopting this technology quickly, by putting training materials directly in the video visit encounter navigator, we have been able to provide training materials at the fingertips to our providers. Now they can kind of do some good old fashioned on the job training. It’s not learning from a colleague or maybe some bad habits, but they’re getting direct access to training documents that have been approved by our Epic governance committees. They’re right at their fingertips, right in their workflow. This has been really well received and it gives us some real confidence about how we could implement this further.
Reducing Help Desk Calls
Jerrie Rankin:
Another thought is our collaboration with IS. We think we can help reduce the level one Help Desk calls. How do we take a look at what they’re receiving? What are those topics? How can we use uPerform to put content in the appropriate workflows, so we can keep those calls away from the help desk from the very beginning? We’re excited to work with them on that.
Getting the Right Information to End Users
Jerrie Rankin:
I think one of the things that I’m the most excited about is that this helps us address one of our biggest challenges: How to get information to the end users? I mean, to the front lines. You know, we all have newsletters and, while newsletters are good, they’re really not the answer. We know that context-based assistance right within the workflow is a better solution. I mean, we can get changes out to leaders through our leader channels. We can get them to the physician leaders and the operational leaders. But oftentimes, it doesn’t filter down to the frontline user who needs it every day. So, this is going to give us an avenue to put that information right where they need it in their workflow, and that that is really exciting to me.
Continuous Improvement of Computer Based Learning Tools
Jerrie Rankin:
Lastly, one of the things that I’m looking forward to is the continuous improvement of our computer-based learning tools, just everything that Nick talked about. Not only embedding it in tip sheets and all kinds of things that we have been able to do. You know, I was in operations for over 25 years before joining the informatics team, and I can tell you that getting staff trained quickly and efficiently is a valid business need. It’s something that your operational folks are asking for all the time. Anything that we can do to speed up that process is a huge win for our system.
I just can’t say enough about how proud I am of the job our team has done today and I’m excited about what’s coming in the future. I really, really appreciate you giving us the opportunity to share this with you today, Ryan.
Ryan Seratt:
Absolutely. Well, I’d like to thank you both for taking time to share your story and about how innovative training practices are actively in enabling Baylor Scott & White Health to better meet the needs of the patients that you serve.
Jerrie Rankin:
Thank you. It’s an honor. Thank you.

What Happens During an EHR Digital Learning Class?
July 22, 2020
314e Employee
EHR Services
If you’ve never participated in a digital learning class, it can be difficult to imagine what it’s like. We’re all pretty accustomed to the traditional classroom setting and approach, but given that scalability and cost containment (not to mention, the Coronavirus pandemic) are pressing needs for large health systems, more clients are wisely opting for
EHR digital learning
to deliver Epic training. One of the beautiful aspects of digital learning is that technology can be leveraged to provide a more interactive, more effective and more
personalized training
experience for end users. Many folks may assume that EHR digital learning means sticking a video in front of end users and calling it a day. But well-executed EHR training encompasses much more than watching hokey movies. Let’s look at what it’s like to participate in an EHR digital learning class.
Multimedia Content for a Rich Digital Learning Experience
Yes, videos are involved. But, EHR digital learning is about more than passive consumption. eLearning modules created for Epic on-boarding, for example, may include interactive elements such as quizzes, simulations and even activities to encourage retention and attention. Unlike traditional lecture-style training sessions, eLearning seeks to encourage participation, despite the one-on-one access made possible by virtual training media. Because we’re generally no longer used to the discipline of sitting in a room, listening to content overview for hours on end and processing information effectively in this manner, rich multimedia content is a great way to leverage the “just press play” aspect of EHR digital learning without losing the end goal: successful retention and application of the material.
Consistent Delivery with Digital Learning EHR Training
It would be impossible to imagine that a single trainer could tackle an entire hospital staff for EHR training. By introducing multiple (or even a whole team of) trainers to handle the job, however, there’s also the introduction of varied content coverage and experience. Even with the best training plan and scripts in hand, we’re human and we’re prone to read our audiences and change things up. This isn’t a bad thing, per se, but what’s lost is consistency and fidelity to the same content for everyone. The risk is that some end users will be better suited for
EHR go-live
, such as those who attended a smaller class with a more engaging personality running the training course, while others may falter and take away very little to justify the time away from clinic.
Recorded Training Content Allows for Targeted Training Review
Not only do all end users get the same EHR training with digital learning classes, but users also have access to review (rewind) the content when needed. Again, they’re getting the same message and same opportunity for mastery. With a modular training approach, end users can also focus on specific components or workflows for which they need more review, versus having to revisit the entire course.
It’s not uncommon for Epic training via digital learning to consist of a library of informational videos, each of which is capped off with a quiz or assessment of some sort to validate aptitude before moving on to the next subject. If an end user doesn’t demonstrate acceptable grasp of a given subject or functionality to “pass” (which can be determined by a given healthcare organization), that subject can be reviewed right away before moving on to other topics, many of which may build on a foundational understanding that needs more time for that particular participant. This tailored approach to EHR training produces far more prepared end users and minimizes barriers to adoption.
EHR Training Benchmarks to Measure Success
One of the most valued aspects of EHR digital learning, especially for large hospitals and health systems, is that a standardized approach can be taken for measuring comprehension and readiness. Instead of assuming that everyone who has passed through the course is adequately up to speed on all the critical EHR functionality needed to do their jobs, hospitals can review metrics based on assessments and completion of training modules to evaluate opportunities for additional training (or even changes to the EHR itself) or move forward based on data, not just faith.
So throw out your ideas of educational videos from health class and embrace the tremendous value of EHR digital learning for preparing clinical end users for smooth go-live and strong utilization.

The Importance of Patient Data Archival in the Era of COVID-19
May 12, 2020
314e Employee
Interoperability
Currently, we are experiencing the important need to fight and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Appropriate testing and collection of the right clinical and other information is vital for the treatment and spread of the virus. Conducting the right tests on infected individuals will help in shaping the treatment for the patient, enabling the isolation of those infected and drastically help in the identification and allocation of the right medical professionals.
Data Archival and Conversion for COVID-19 (and other Pandemics in the Future)
As we go through the unprecedented rise of the COVID-19 pandemic across the globe, we are overwhelmed by the amount of information that comes through from various channels. Information comes in various forms such as articles, images, video, statistics and graphs. It also comes from a range of outlets, including hospital systems, public health databases, social media & news outlets, journals, preprints and a host of other data sources. The sources of information expand from governmental agencies to research institutions, from policymakers to advocacy groups. Healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, and other organizations that need the data are now questioning the need to archive these rich and diverse forms of information that will be foundational for epidemiology studies. Research organizations, pharmaceutical agencies, public health agencies, the scientific community, medical device manufacturers and others will benefit from analyzing and exploring the data for scientific, sociological, political and cultural aspects of the pandemic in finding a cure and creating predictive models for infectious diseases in the future. Given the diverse, variable and fluid nature of information, the process of data archival is vital across both individual and institutional levels.
Research will benefit from the correlation aggregation of data from various sources as indicated above. The use of historical data, data conversion of heterogeneous forms of data silos and standardized storage of multi-source data using a standards-based approach is the right mechanism for analyzing the huge volume of data generated today from the pandemic. Healthcare organizations need to create strategies for appropriate data collection, data storage and data management, as well as an exhaustive big data strategy to consume current research to evaluate the impact on large scale biological, social, financial and environmental aspects across the world.
Rapid Solutions for Patient Data Collection
The fight against pandemics is only possible without major losses to life through the development of rapid solutions. Rapid solutions need the industry to carry-out patient-centered research of similar pandemics from the past. A retrospective review of similar diseases can be significant to improve patient outcomes and control pandemics. A strategic approach for data collection, management and reporting becomes essential for faster solution design. Patient
data archival
repositories could be helpful to perform systematic reviews and randomized trials followed by probable and retrospective studies. Retrospective studies have a great dependence on the availability and accuracy of the subject’s medical record. The analysis of historical data is performed after the patient cohorts are determined and then controlled intervention is applied to the resulting cohort. The intervention, baseline state and outcome are obtained from existing information that is currently stored in EMR databases, devices and other sources.
Conclusion – Patient Data Collection
The current series of events that are happening in the world makes us believe in the importance of insights-based decision making, which is made available through the collection of a large amount of data across different walks of life. The science of epidemiology largely depends on the quality and quantity of data that is collected from health-related subjects.
The most cost-effective strategies for increasing pandemic preparedness, especially in resource-constrained settings, consist of investing to strengthen core public health infrastructure, increasing situational awareness and rapidly extinguishing sparks that could lead to pandemics. This is not possible without the aggregation and examination of data from many sources to derive insights. When used to study and fight global outbreaks, pandemic analytics is a modern way to combat public health issues.

How Flexibility in Data Standards can Support Interoperability in Healthcare
January 22, 2020
314e Employee
Interoperability
If there’s one thing that becomes quickly apparent when working in healthcare IT, it’s that the concept of “data standards” are all over the place. Sure, there are established formats and languages that allow for meaningful communication between EHRs, devices, organizations, etc. But when it comes to real life integration and pursuing true healthcare interoperability, a health system’s ability to deal with, and even ingest various data standards (however textbook or
not
they may be), makes all the difference in partnership and growth opportunities. Focusing on
FHIR implementations
, for example, is great. But it’s important to recognize that many meaningful data elements are just an older HL7 file or JSON away. Imagine the potential for powering an Epic EHR or even a Health Information Exchange based on a plethora of data sources versus only those that comply with the latest-and-greatest.
Interoperability: Greater than the Sum of Parts
Given the push toward coordinated care,
interoperability between EHRs and health systems
is increasingly becoming the norm, not to mention a catalyst for contracts and lucrative partnerships. The value of integration between health technologies is that healthcare providers and hospital administrators are able to pull together a robust volume of PHI that allows for:
Better decision making
Cost savings
Improved patient outcomes
Reduced readmissions and complications during care
But here’s the rub: those results can only be realized when a critical mass of information is flowing and available. If a healthcare organization can’t get enough health data to really impact care, then they’re going to be hard pressed to justify future integration efforts…regardless of the promise.
Flexible Standards for Healthcare Data Make Room for Everyone at the Table
Let’s say that the preference of the hospital is to deal in FHIR interfaces exclusively. We certainly don’t blame an entity for trying to streamline, to work with the latest-and-greatest and to employ a team who expertly understands the standard-of-choice. But this is healthcare, folks. Sometimes the “little guys” — ambulatory clinics, local labs, radiology practices, etc. — provide critical pieces of the care plan puzzle. In our experience, the these smaller entities rarely support the most current formats. You may be dealing with an over-simplified API endpoint, offered up a scrappy little JSON file as the payload, and wondering how you’re supposed to ingest this into your sophisticated data model.
Yes, there’s work involved, but it’s good work to do. Every time a health system (or interoperability “sponsor”) completes the exercise of ingesting a new technology or file type, they’re adding a slew of potential integrations to their list that could add value to the overall efforts toward comprehensive health records. While not all third-party applications work the same, if you’ve dealt with a handful of CDA payloads, why not go after other partners who are utilizing similar technology? This kind of strategy can add quick “wins” to the overall desire to connect a care community and move closer to coordinate care within a network of providers and organizations.
The Resource Burden To Support Data Standards Across The Spectrum
We don’t know any hospital or health system who has the intention of building up their IT staff to rival the roster of their physicians. Leveraging healthcare IT consultants who can provide the on-time skillsets needed to support a given implementation is wise for getting the right help just when it’s needed…and then moving on to the next project (and standard, of course).

3 Reasons You Need Professional Healthcare IT Testing for Interoperability
June 10, 2020
314e Employee
Interoperability
We’ve worked with many healthcare clients over the years, and while there is no shortage of impressive and innovative solutions out there to support patient care, there are limitations to how successful those implementations will be without proper support. Delivering interoperability for hospitals and health systems is not exactly a simple task, but when the project team is stacked with the right resources, the dream of comprehensive care records and improved population health comes much closer to reality for the sponsoring entity. A critical aspect of this process is a well-planned, detailed testing plan to ensure that clinicians and patients alike can embrace new technology with full confidence in the data and security behind it. Let’s examine three specific reasons for opting for
professional healthcare IT testing
to drive interoperability among care solutions.
One of the pitfalls of utilizing Super Users (or “borrowing” any other clinical end user) for testing duty is that, generally speaking, most of these folks are going to be somewhat limited in their ability to fully vet the solution. They’re medical professionals, after all, not health IT testers! Not only is their time exceedingly valuable elsewhere given the pressure on care delivery and the volume most hospitals are dealing with, but there are aspects of a technology solution — even healthcare-centric technology — that are best evaluated by a professional quality assurance resource.
Sure, a savvy nurse or applications specialist can run the workflows and confirm functionality, but an experienced interoperability tester is able to take into consideration the whole spectrum of features and functions, including:
Data fidelity and database mapping
Exception case handling
Login experience and logout confirmation for security
System performance and load handling
User authentication and role-based access testing
An area that health system executives often don’t consider is how their
HIPAA policies
are actually verified. You can develop the most impressive-sounding guidelines for your organization, but if employees and vendors — including healthcare IT partners working under a BAA — aren’t ever measured on their alignment with these well-meaning statements, then they’re meaningless. And more importantly, your organization is at risk.
Consider, then, the value of having a documented set of test cases to use as validation that the interoperable systems powering care delivery were vetted against specific controls called out in the organization’s HIPAA policy. An entity can claim that strong passwords are required and logout occurs after twenty minutes…but does it really? Can users disable those security measures? (Pro Tip: If they can, they will. Lock it down.)
Without a qualified testing professional thoroughly evaluating aspects beyond just feature-function, you’re susceptible to unsavory surprises and unexpected work-arounds that render your whole security policy weak.
Integration projects in the healthcare space have a tendency to grow and morph over time. As new solutions or APIs are available, the ability to leverage existing systems more effectively is often enhanced by the latest-and-greatest tools to market. This means that interoperability is never really done, though. Engaging professional testing for the full health IT solution is the best way to ensure that regression testing is performed faithfully at every iteration of the project. It’s not uncommon for novice testers to rely on
“smoke tests”
as updates and bugs ebb and flow, focusing only on the updated or new functionality.
Confidence in the full spectrum of the healthcare solution is key, however, and failing to invoke true end-to-end regression testing before pushing out a live system is a recipe for disaster. Every interface counts, every data point matters, and every potential user entry must be reviewed to ensure everything functions as expected, especially when clinical decision rests on the data available (or not).
Developing detailed test cases (as previously discussed), ensuring that they’re updated each release or iteration, and ensuring that proper regression testing occurs on all potentially impacted system is vital for interoperability success.

3 Aspects of Epic Interfaces Worth Outsourcing
June 17, 2020
314e Employee
Staff Augmentation
Making the most of an investment like an EHR for a large health system has a lot to do with the ability to scale the technology and leverage capabilities for connectivity. After all, modern healthcare doesn’t allow any of us to operate in a bubble, and a hospital or health organization’s ability to share and gather data has everything to do with their ability to grow and thrive.
EHR interfaces
are the key to unlocking the power of comprehensive care records and real-time clinical information. However, there are some aspects of Epic interfaces that are critical and complex enough to warrant calling in some help. We hear often that hospital IT resources are pulled in many directions and have no shortage of tasks on their plates, so bringing in dedicated experts to execute some of the efforts we’ll discuss below may enable interoperability as quickly and efficiently as is desired.
Some of the most promising opportunities for improving clinical outcomes, increasing revenue and controlling costs are tied to emerging devices for healthcare IT. From patient wearables to physician tools, capitalizing on the mobility and data capabilities of the latest and greatest medical device technology is one of the key ways that hospitals can move the needle on core business metrics. But that data can’t exist in another silo or tool; the information is only as valuable as the ability to unite that data with other touch points to provide actionable intel and drive behavior.
Hiring an Epic interface expert to bring the information from medical devices to the EHR (and therefore to the point of care) makes all the difference in realizing the promises of said device. Technology is great, but streamlining the workflow to enable physicians to focus on medicine will make or break an implementation. A solid interface will support the on-the-go capabilities of many tools on the market, ensuring that data is never lost and that breaks in connectivity are handled well. Because this handling often requires middleware to bridge the gap between device and EHR, it’s worth bringing in interface pros to build an ironclad connection.
It’s not uncommon for most hospitals to want to thoroughly vet their own solutions, especially given the liability involved. We get that. However, proper
testing of Epic interfaces
and healthcare IT in general is a major task with many best practices that an average clinical or administrative end user won’t know to observe.
With professional testers, you can get:
Automated testing
Cross-system validation
Database validation (if applicable)
Detailed test cases
Full End-to-end testing
Regression testing
Role-based access validation
Upgrade
and patch testing
While end users and Super Users absolutely have their place when it comes to UAT, professional Epic interface testers will be able to deliver a layer of confidence that cannot be understated. Not to mention, trained QA resources can often validate security components that make HIPAA compliance possible and protect the integrity of in-motion and at rest data alike.
Many healthcare organizations look forward to free-flowing records within their communities, and Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) are one way that this becomes more attainable. Not every practice, surgery center or ancillary provider in a geographic location will share the same EHR, which is when the ability for interfaces to support interoperability become clutch for unlocking the possibility of an impactful HIE.
Given the popularity and capabilities of Epic as an EHR, some hospitals find that they have access to more data than most of their counterparts using other technologies. But when the goal is collaboration and removing borders, interfacing with whatever robust or home-spun standards are floating around in a community becomes the central focus of a HIE. And in our experience, the ability of a regional HIE to interface back to Epic and others is just as important as how it consumes and corroborates the inbound data. Again, leaning on professionals for Epic interfaces to a HIE or any other endpoint is a great way to ensure fidelity of that interoperability and account for the less-than-happy-path scenarios as well.

The Benefits of Healthcare IT Staff Augmentation for Acute Needs
May 14, 2020
314e Employee
Staff Augmentation
Despite the influx of federal funding in response to COVID-19, it’s a mild understatement to say that the state of employment and life in general is uncertain and disrupted. Speculation abounds around what life will be like when normalcy resumes: Will telehealth and telecommuting continue? How long will we wear masks and clear the shelves of sanitizer? When will we really be on the downslope of the illustrious curve we’re all trying to flatten? So much is yet to be seen, but one clear solution during this tumultuous time is that
staff augmentation in healthcare IT
may be more valuable than ever for the foreseeable future.
We’re not Angling for Staff Layoffs
Let us start first by making it crystal clear that we’re not advocating that hospitals and health systems lay off their IT staff. Now more than ever, people are depending on their jobs where they can keep them, especially as initiatives like the
Payroll Protection Program
are created to encourage employee retention during the Coronavirus Crisis. The idea isn’t to ditch loyal employees and seek out the cheapest option. No, our focus is to leverage the flexibility of staff augmentation for hospitals to weather the storms of this virus well, for however long this season lasts.
Healthcare IT as we Know it will Change
COVID-19 has been a historic event that many of us will be talking about and dealing with for decades. (Heck, we’re still in it!) For hospitals in particular, practices and tools will be reconsidered permanently given what we’ve learned (often the hard way) as a result of this rapidly-spreading pandemic. Healthcare IT will see changes across the spectrum as we collectively focus on population health and infectious disease screening and contact models, and the technologies and solutions will certainly reflect that.
Not to mention, we’ve seen a rise in acceptance and usage of virtual IT solutions and apps, as well as telemedicine taking the lead as first-line care to triage suspected COVID-19 cases. While mass adoption of the cutting edge healthcare IT solutions always seemed just around the corner, it seems we’ve eagerly incorporated them into nearly every facet of current patient care to better tackle the aggressive virus. We applaud this progress, though of course lament the means.
Healthcare Staff Augmentation Reduces Long-Term Burdens for Health Systems
As a result of this massive shift and forward momentum, there will be a desire and need for health systems to seek out the best long-term solutions and strategies to recover from the current strain, as well as prepare for what could potentially come next. Increasing healthcare IT staff in the wake of an economic crisis could be challenging on several fronts, be it resource burn out, budget deficits, increased demand, etc. But staff augmentation is a fantastic solution to overcome these challenges given that highly-skilled healthcare IT resources are leveraged only for the time and focus needed.
For example, if it’s determined that
Epic optimization
projects are needed to better prepare and respond to the fall out effects of this acute crisis, Epic project teams can be assembled using contract resources who are able to swiftly implement changes to the
EHR (and peripheral integrations)
without requiring benefits, overhead, etc. Simultaneous health IT initiatives are possible when employed staff are not overly taxed, but rather supplemented with trainers, developers and project managers on an as-needed-basis. This ensures the critical work gets done efficiently, while reducing the need for hospitals to carry additional staff for the long-term.
Contract Healthcare IT Resources are Adaptable and Effective
Hiring a healthcare IT firm to source and staff Epic initiatives (or any others) also creates an environment in which the current climate of employment is far less of a disruption to advancement. It would be unwise and simply untrue to say that anyone has gone unaffected by COVID-19, but project-based staff augmentation resources are accustomed to remote work. Teleconferences and lacking requirements aren’t unusual for these folks, and certainly having the expertise to roll with challenges of stakeholder attention despite accelerated timelines (due to pressing needs) is not going to stall out progress. Whereas hospital IT staff may work optimally with fixed variables and due process, contract Epic project teams are adaptable and can pull from extensive experience overcoming hurdles…be them novel diseases or novel integrations.

Full-Time Work vs. Contracting – Thinking of Making a Jump?
March 30, 2017
314e Employee
Staff Augmentation
As a recruiting firm, we see many full-time employees at provider organizations longing to move into the consulting world. On the flip side, there are contractors who are now looking to “settle down” into a full-time job with benefits.There seems to be a recurring question: Which is better? The answer can be confusing and a little frustrating – “It depends!” What works for one person may not be the best solution for everyone else.
Let’s take a step back and start with one basic question, regardless of whether you are currently looking to move into or out of contract work.
Why are you looking to change your situation?
Typically answers range from the quest for better compensation (money/benefits/security or all of those) or because you are bored at your current workplace, and are looking for a new challenge.
In the Healthcare IT space, traditionally employers were hiring full-time employees and offering job security, paid time off, and other benefits like health coverage and, in some cases, a pension plan. This landscape is gradually changing. As organizations update their IT needs, they are looking for a larger percentage of contractors with newer skills.
A majority of the workforce in today’s Healthcare IT industry consists of contractors, who step in as-needed, leaving when a task is accomplished. They expand their skills, gain exposure to various client sites, and work to stay up to date in the marketplace.
Here are some things to keep in mind if you want to move to consulting:
You get to decide if you would like to work at a certain location, and if you want to pursue the project. You set boundaries for your work life i.e. pursue projects with a certain percentage of remote work, take time off between contracts, or work at sites close to home.
Jobs may not align consecutively, potentially leading to down-time between contracts. This is more prevalent if you have very specific requirements for the contracts you are willing to consider.
You need to stay sharp all the time. Keep your resume updated, and be ready to interview for your next project at short notice.
Even if the team loves your work, sometimes funding for projects is not in their control. This results in layoffs and typically contractors are the first to be let go.
You do not really get to choose the managers you would like to work with. Leaving a good impression and working with various personalities is a basic survival skill for a contractor.
Network, network, network – Hiring managers, admins, HR, and colleagues from various projects form a critical network to help you find future projects.
Stay in touch with recruiters from various agencies. Many times, the same recruiter whom you may have brushed off when you had a lot of work coming your way, might be the doorway to your next dream project. This is probably more important today than ever before, since now recruiters at staffing firms have advanced systems to keep detailed records of past interactions with candidates and usually know about past issues where commitments were not honored or there was negative feedback from a client.
There are possible tax advantages, especially if you incorporate yourself and can work C2C or 1099.
Travel based consulting comes with its share of free airline miles and expenses covered by the customer, though cost cutting and frugality is becoming increasingly important in this area.
Full-time employment has its advantages too:
Right from the interview stages, you can look for a “feel” of the workplace and the manager, since you will be there long term. The selection process is usually a two way street and the candidate picks the job as much as the hiring manager picks the team.
There is more job stability comparatively, as well as other benefits such as regular paychecks, paid time off, benefits, workers comp, etc.
Full-time employment is typically not as competitive as being a contractor. In return for this security, the cash component of compensation is usually less than a consultant.
If you are comfortable with a little instability, as a contractor, you tend to have a better cash compensation. You get to work on a spectrum of exciting projects (depending on how specific you are) and interact with different teams. Keep in mind the entire package of salary, paid time off and other benefits to compare apples to apples when you look at both.
From an organization’s business perspective, it makes more sense to bring in highly skilled workers, who keep their skill set on the cutting edge. Even if they cost more per hour, it translates into lower costs overall and a lot more flexibility in hiring. After all, if someone is not the right fit for any reason – personality or skill, it’s much easier to let them go if they are a consultant.
There is a middle ground, which you could consider. Work for a consulting firm as a full-time employee. This can combine the stability of a regular income, with the excitement of working on various projects and constantly learning from new challenges at different customer sites. When we speak with candidates to assist them in selecting the path they want to take, these are some of the considerations we want to present before they decide for themselves what the right fit will be, and to evaluate their reasons for considering their next career move.

UIC Partners with 314e to Assess its ICD-10 Readiness
The University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System (UI Health) provides comprehensive care, education, and research to the people of Illinois and beyond. A part of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), UI Health comprises a clinical enterprise that includes a 495-bed tertiary care hospital, 22 outpatient clinics, and 13 Mile Square Health Center facilities, which are Federally Qualified Health Centers. It also includes the seven UIC health science colleges: the College of Applied Health Sciences; the College of Dentistry; the School of Public Health; the Jane Addams College of Social Work; and the Colleges of Medicine, Pharmacy, and Nursing, including regional campuses in Peoria, Quad Cities, Rockford, Springfield, and Urbana. UI Health is dedicated to the pursuit of health equity.

Revenue Cycle
In July 2015, UI Health partnered with 314e to support their ICD-10 Go-Live. The engagement was to provide an ICD-10 readiness assessment along with developing an executive dashboard of key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor overall impact to the organization. The dashboard provided the team insight into both financial and operational actionable data. This allowed the executive team to make quick decisions and see where there may be a potential issue compared to baseline data.
Overall, the KPIs returned to baseline within a few months.  The leadership team has since incorporated the dashboard into their operational processes.

3 Tips for Implementing a HIE That Actually Delivers Value
November 13, 2019
314e Employee
Interoperability
It is no small effort for healthcare systems to implement a Health Information Exchange (HIE). Whether the goal is electronically traversing a hospital or health system, or connecting the community to improve coordination of care, the task of integrating and leveraging disparate health records is daunting…and yet it’s critical to effectively manage patient populations throughout the course of care.
So how can a healthcare organization ensure that their efforts are not in vain and that their investment truly pays off? Let’s take a look at three tips for effectively implementing an HIE that actually gains traction, provides value and delivers on anticipated ROIs.
This approach could also be classified as a “quick win” approach, but the goal is to look at where you are going to get enough swift payback to encourage forward momentum on the HIE implementation project. Also known as the
power of the Progress Principal
, when your overall vision for an integrated and tightly-knit web of connected electronic health records and ancillary data is met with breakthroughs that deliver early value and satisfaction to stakeholders (be it hospital executives, physicians, an ACO, or even patients), your organization is far more likely to stay the course and see it through the tougher moments or setbacks. Because those are inevitable, as any
healthcare IT expert
will tell you.
Strategy in Action
What does this mean practically? Let’s say that the advisory team that is driving the HIE project identifies that an acute pain point when it comes to their community healthcare model is that they are struggling to get reports out of the ED before a patient returns to their PCP for follow up. It’s not uncommon across the country to hear this very concern, especially given the expectations on both parties for effectively managing this handoff and ensuring medications are managed and reconciled to avoid re-admission. (In fact, most quality care models have a metric to deter this very activity.)
Imagine the perception of value across the care team for the HIE implementation efforts if the project plan prioritizes integrating the ED’s EHR (let’s say Epic, for example) to the HIE. While it may still be some time before those reports are delivered to the point of care via a CCD, having a portal or other mechanism by which providers can get access to the ED episodic report within that post-admission period could have significant positive ramifications and reduce liability.
Leading HIE efforts with a strategic connection to quickly answer a local pain point can go a long way for gaining support and removing barriers as the project moves forward.
We’ve seen it time and again where UI/UX takes a back seat to “the technical stuff.” And while an ironclad integration between systems is paramount to the success of an HIE, a healthcare organization is going to have a difficult time getting traction or seeing that data become actionable if the methods for accessing it are cumbersome or poorly developed. Form follows function, so it’s key that the methods for delivering care records are intuitive and reliable.
The optimal path for data retrieval is a CCD for recent episodes of care residing right in a physician’s existing EHR, populated with a comprehensive view via the HIE. However, in the absence of this workflow, an easily-navigated health exchange portal can still provide necessary data without introducing cumbersome workflows. In practice, we often find that physician support staff such as RNs, MAs, or even front office staff are well-poised to own the portal logins, ensuring easy access to community records and even allowing for care summary uploads where electronic records are not yet implemented. (Yes, that’s still a thing.)
Incentives are a powerful way to impact behavior, and nothing speaks higher to care partners than a robust referral network. Health system sponsors driving implementation of an HIE in their community can inspire significant buy-in — which ultimately results in a well-developed HIE that truly represents the care spectrum for shared patients — when they create a network of connected physicians, ancillary providers, and care facilities. Establishing a “preferred network” on the basis of HIE participation truly moves the needle on the volume and quality of data available within those CCDs or HIE patient records.
Best Practices to Help a HIE Flourish
In capitated care models where entities such as payers or ACOs are responsible for patients across the care continuum, we’ve seen great success via health information exchanges when use of and integration with the health data repository is treated as another metric of success. When referrals or even financial incentives are developed to encourage adoption and utilization of HIEs, health organizations inevitably see greater buy-in. This also contributes to the perception of a valuable glimpse into patients’ care records, making whatever “work” is required to get the data worthwhile.
When we give physicians and ancillary providers the information to better care for their patients, everyone wins!

How to Prepare for Epic Optimization and Upgrades
June 24, 2020
314e Employee
EHR Services
Getting an Epic instance up and running is an exciting milestone for any health system, but it’s generally not too long before talk of optimization or an upgrade begins. Given the robust nature of Epic as an EHR, it’s not surprising that hospitals would want to take advantage of all that the healthcare IT solution has to offer by updating and streamlining workflows and integrations. Knowing how to prepare for
Epic optimization
goes a long way in bracing for some additional change, but also embracing the value of the upgrade to extend the investment for the organization.
We realize we’re talking about grown adults here, so making something mandatory doesn’t necessarily guarantee participation. However, we still advocate for treating EHR optimization and upgrade efforts with the same level of coordination and detail as you would an
Epic implementation
To this end, it’s important to communicate the value of the Epic upgrade to end users, just as with the initial roll out. Communication plans should incorporate the same level of detail, forethought and exposure to ensure that staff knows what’s coming, when it’s coming and why they need to be aware…not to mention, what’s expected of them (like training). This fosters better training attendance (or participation, if you’re opting for a
digital learning approach to Epic upgrade training
), and can even reinforce the importance of their feedback by seeing requests come to fruition.
Much in the same way we recommend approaching optimization training in the same manner as the initial implementation, it’s just as important to invoke formal testing/QA to support upgrades. While it may be true that no integrations were touched and everything “should” behave the same after the update, it’s the job of the Epic project management team to insist on another full round of testing (known as regression testing, when changes have been introduced to an already vetted solution) before launching the new version.
If the changes to an existing EHR instance are deemed minor, it would be easy for some to overlook the value of another full round of testing, citing budgetary and timeline concerns. We get it; those are always metrics that we’re looking to pare down in the implementation process. However, the value cannot be underestimated, and opting for even a lean round of testing the optimized Epic instance against the expected ecosystem — interoperable systems, ancillary integrations, patient management tools/plug-ins, etc. — better prepares health systems for the imminent changes without disrupting clinical throughput.
We’re talking about healthcare technology here, and we’ve been around long enough to know that even the best testing and development can’t preclude all post-upgrade issues. Even if there is a minor spike in reports of EHR issues or new challenges with recently introduced workflows, it’s prudent of hospitals to ensure their help desk and IT department are properly staffed and prepared for whatever potential issues may arise directly after Epic optimization.
Just as an organization would prepare for
Epic go-live
, so too should they prepare for EHR optimization and upgrades. This includes training efforts, end-to-end testing and help desk staffing, among other things. Preparing for the unexpected will reduce friction and help clinical end users easily adapt to Epic optimization and upgrades, enjoying the benefits of their robust new health record.

EHR Go-Live Support from a Distance of Six Feet
April 15, 2020
314e Employee
EHR Services
It’s safe to say that the preferred method of
Epic go-live support
as at-the-elbow (ATE) assistance for clinicians is not going to be common practice right now. Nevertheless, existing Epic implementation efforts will need to continue where possible, albeit in a modified manner. Given the current strain on healthcare providers and administrators as they deal with COVID-19, some hospitals may opt to delay healthcare IT initiatives, while others may find themselves needing the anticipated improvements and optimizations more than ever. For health systems falling in the latter camp, we’ll share a few modifications that can be expected for EHR go-live support that honors social distancing best practices.
Physical Epic Go-Live Support off the Floor
We’re all aware of the circumstances under which many doctors and nurses are working to feverishly fight Coronavirus from the front lines. But to be fair, unless we’ve been in an impacted health facility, we can probably only start to understand the gravity of the situation. Given the
scarcity of PPE
and resources to support healthcare staff, it would be unwise to put
Epic trainers
and ATE support teams in a setting to warrant desperately needed protective gear. While physical, on-site assistance may very well be the most effective way to be there for Epic end users during go-live, it doesn’t have to be on the floor (as may usually be the case).
Much as setting up a “War Room” for EHR go-live efforts can be beneficial for assembling all the right people in once place — from developers and project managers to trainers and hospital IT resources — so too can a launch room type arrangement make for a place to go when help is needed without disrupting the busy, hazardous conditions where patients are being admitted and treated.
Virtual Go-Live Team to Drive Epic Implementation
For heavily impacted hospitals, even a separate location on premise for the Epic go-live team may very well be too close for comfort for everyone involved. In such cases, utilizing technology to connect clinical end users to virtual support for resolving issues or reviewing new workflows may best serve everyone involved.
Virtual training provides remote capabilities and solutions that are increasingly important. The primary strength of virtual training is that students are not restricted to a single location. Improvements in internet speeds and in the tools themselves over the last few years makes virtual training a reliable training method with a strong future.
Setting up open lines of communication where physicians and ancillary staff can jump in as needed will allow for minimal disruption while still supporting roll-out efforts as planned. Providers can even do this right from the point-of-care, though patient security and consent should be taken into consideration if any video mediums are to be used for EHR support.
Slow and Steady Still gets the Job Done
Much as it is foolish to expect working parents to do a stellar job homeschooling their children for the first time during the COVID-19 crisis, it’s also unreasonable to expect that heavily burdened medical professionals are going to take to new technology right now easily or smoothly. However, that doesn’t mean that all efforts should be called off, especially when the anticipated benefits of Epic implementation or
EHR upgrades
justify the work.
The best approach here is to honor the slow and steady method, and to realize that some progress is better than no progress at all. We are in unprecedented times and the stress for these end users is unimaginable. It goes a long way to remember that we’re dealing with people, and the more we can sympathize with priorities and make new workflows or functionality as simple as possible, the better chances we can drive Epic adoption and get the job done.

The Importance of Communicating Value for Successful Epic Implementations
November 27, 2019
314e Employee
EHR Services
To successfully implement Epic into hospitals and health systems, there are thousands of hours of work involved. Given the scale and level of commitment required to make Epic go-live successful and EHR adoption a reality, missing a step could result in the entire timeline and project plan sliding completely off track. Take it from us: one of the most critical steps in this process is
communication
Remember “The Why” for Implementing Epic
Healthcare IT implementation teams are generally well versed in what it takes to deliver software and solutions that function, but that’s only half the picture. The most perfectly integrated EHR, HIE, LMS, you name it, won’t contribute to realized improvements unless the end user understands why they are being asked to learn a new system in the first place (and is therefore willing to use it). Health systems weigh many factors and consider budgets on the scale of millions when it comes to implementing Epic and other critical health IT components. This is no small decision, and we know those considerations aren’t taken lightly. So, it’s paramount that “
The Why
” is communicated to end users to see the efforts through.
It would be foolish to expect that a busy physician will be willing to drop everything, disrupt their already busy clinical schedule and introduce a potential delay to their patients as they learn a new workflow, simply because they were told to do so. Hospital administrators have significant clout, no doubt, but so do the healthcare providers at the point of care. If the goal is to implement Epic for the sake of serving these highly-skilled end users, you’d better ensure they understand the goal of the new technology and why it’s so important to the organization.
Include End Users Early on to Demonstrate a Commitment to Collaboration
Want end users to get on board? Simple: include them from the beginning! We can’t tell you how many times we’ve walked into training sessions for physicians and their clinical staff, only to be met with blank stares as we start talking about their beautiful new Epic instance. Leaving the key users of the system in the dark up until the point of training is far too late. Not only is your trainer walking in cold to deliver the why, the how — in addition to the practical steps of using Epic in their daily practice to serve patients — but attendees are far more likely to balk at the idea of change when their opinions have never been considered or sought.
Demonstrating a commitment to collaboration goes a long way in setting the stage for a smooth Epic implementation. There is no tool more powerful in this arsenal than communication…good, open communication where questions are welcomed and end users are respected as the client.
Let’s repeat that: end users are the clients when it comes to implementing EHRs. Physicians, nurses, ancillary staff, front desk — these are the people who will bring all those integration and implementation efforts to life! If the goal is to please only the folks signing the checks, then opportunities are missed, and the solution will suffer as a result.
Set Expectations for Epic Engagement Before Training
We all know that it’s not fair to shoot the messenger. In this spirit, it’s unwise for Epic implementation teams to let the trainer deliver the mandate for how end users are expected to interact with the EHR and/or what metrics will be used to measure this activity. In many cases, Epic Trainers are consultants, or at the very least not employed by the hospital system. The idea that an “outsider” will be the first to tell doctors and nurses how the organization expects them to use the system is not ideal.
As early as possible in the process of implementing Epic, hospital leadership should formally announce the initiative internally (via a town hall style meeting, employee portal, whatever is applicable for the organization) to raise awareness, encourage adoption from the get-go, share the vision and set expectations within this context. By taking this step early, it not only gives the project plenty of breathing room to settle in long before logins are shared and training takes place, but it creates an environment in which everyone is in the loop, and therefore staff are far less likely to resist the change when it’s time to deliver.
Respect and Integrity go a Long Way in Communicating Well
At the end of the day, the best question a hospital executive or Epic PM can ask is,
“How would I want to be communicated to?”
By placing ourselves in the end user’s shoes, we can quickly identify opportunities to mitigate risk and disruption by improving transparency and messaging to gain supporters from the beginning. This work pays off in dividends when it’s time for Epic Go-Live, with successful adoption just waiting in the wings.

Setting the Stage for a Smooth Epic Implementation Starts with the PM
November 20, 2019
314e Employee
EHR Services
Project Managers are often saddled with much of the responsibility when it comes to the success or struggles of healthcare IT implementation. While it can be a tough burden to bear, it’s nevertheless fair given the important role that PMs play in
implementing software like Epic EHR for hospitals
Accountability is Everything in Healthcare IT Implementations
One of the most important jobs of an Epic PM is to ensure that the implementation team is performing and delivering as expected. Timelines mean nothing if they’re not adhered to, and your plans only take root if developers, integration specialists, analysts, QA resources, and even show up for their given responsibilities. A good project manager will be able to spot (via budget tracking spreadsheets just picking up on patterns, such as resources skipping daily stand-ups) when someone isn’t meeting expectations. But a
great
project manager doesn’t just see the behavior;
they address it.
PM Soft Skills go a Long Way
So-called “Soft Skills” are sometimes overlooked when staffing for technical projects such as Epic implementations, but they’re invaluable when it comes to selecting the Project Manager for the job. Driving accountability is necessary, but not everyone accomplishes this task gracefully. While we certainly need not steer away from asking direct questions in front of the greater audience, it’s prudent for a PM to know when a private conversation needs to happen to address a lack of participation or sub par work.
For example, if the lead Epic trainer assigned to the project is suddenly unresponsive, it’s perfectly acceptable for the PM to request a meeting to discuss potential barriers or even personal issues that are precluding responsiveness. After all, we’re human, and it’s worth acknowledging when something seems amiss without jumping to conclusions about ability. Nevertheless, delaying that conversation could lead to resentment, lack of preparedness for the critical stage of Epic classroom training, or simply ignoring signs that a fellow colleague needs help.
Don’t Assume Risks Will Simply Disappear
The Project Manager is often the unique position of seeing the big picture of an Epic implementation on a regular basis. Whereas an integration expert may be knee deep in APIs and making interoperability possible, they may not have awareness of other components as necessary as their connections for the overall implementation project. Mitigating risk is one of the critical components of good Epic implementation management, and it’s up to the PM to call out risks and make sure they’re dealt with. Just as with addressing accountability head on, ignoring issues before they morph into full-blown threats is the difference between a project that launches on time and on budget (which is, after all, one of the key metrics of a good Epic go-live) and one that never gets off the ground.
Every Implementation Task Should Have One Owner
One. One owner. We can’t stress enough how vital it is to establish a single owner for a given task. While the activity required to execute that task may be handled by a team, if you don’t assign responsibility to a single resource for those efforts, you run the risk of a finger pointing match in which everyone loses.
Who is the ONE resource responsible for securing training rooms and scheduling super users for sessions?
Who is the ONE resource who will oversee testing of the final Epic build before the client does UAT?
Who is the ONE resource to coordinate at-the-elbow support during Go-Live?
If you have more than one name assigned to a given task, it’s highly plausible that one of two things will happen: either each assumes the other is working the task (therefore it doesn’t get done), or each works the task to completion (which results in redundant effort and waste).
The Most Important Question from an Epic Project Manager
Implementation projects are complex and time consuming. The single most powerful question that a healthcare IT PM can ask is, “What blockers can I clear for you?” With this posture, implementing Epic EHR doesn’t have to feel like a behemoth, but rather an opportunity to add tremendous value to a hospital system.

How we can Leverage Epic to Drive COVID-19 Immunity Tracking
May 7, 2020
314e Employee
Data Analytics
While we still in the mindset of reducing the influx of Coronavirus cases to give healthcare workers the opportunity to keep up, it’s worth thinking ahead to our next move: tracking COVID-19 immunity to help restore our economy. Many hospitals and practices throughout the country are still struggling to even test for Coronavirus in populations outside of first responders and patients presenting with the greatest distress (which is not to speak of the backlog in getting those results reported), but looking forward to how we can support and drive immunity identification in a region will go a long way in helping to corral this population health nightmare and encourage whatever normalcy we can hope for in the latter half of 2020. One of the greatest tools that can help drive this effort is already in front of the majority of our healthcare providers: Epic EHR. By applying innovative thinking to leverage the very technology so ubiquitous in hospital and urgent care settings, we can
utilize Epic to drive COVID-19 immunity tracking
based on the latest data coming out of labs and the front lines of care.
Clinical Decision Support via Epic to Better Flag Potential Coronavirus Cases for Strategic Testing
Given the scale and spread of the virus, it’s hard to imagine that testing capacity will fully catch up in the immediate future. Formulating how to better focus testing efforts can go a long way in cleaning up the data we have at a local and national level when it comes to disease rates, especially for diagnosing and establishing immunity. Incorporating Clinical Decision Support in Epic to implement screening questionnaires can improve reporting statistics and help capture more, unique information based on the relevant data points identified by other countries and in vitro studies.
For example, there is mounting evidence that the lack of smell and taste reported by many Coronavirus-positive patients is related to the
gut response to the virus
and
in the gut. Gastrointestinal symptoms shouldn’t be a surprise, and yet we know they’re not routinely part of the screening criteria currently.
Utilizing Clinical Studies to Drive Epic Workflows for Coronavirus Assessments
The value of Epic as a tool right now is that it is already in place in many hospitals and healthcare systems across the nation. Given the configurability of the solution, it’s a point-of-care resource, already within the existing clinical user flow, that can be updated as often as needed to present the most current recommendations (via CDS alerts, as discussed above), as well as provide assessments that be incorporate the latest and greatest data coming out of clinical studies looking at COVID-19. These assessments can then drive workflows, such as suggesting a stool screening when a patient tests negative on the PCR test, but is still suspected of having COVID (given that the virus can shed up to twice as long in the stool as it does in the nasal tissue).
What’s the Point of Testing When There is no Cure?
While we understand the sentiment that
mild cases of COVID-19 will be addressed not all that differently
from the same precautions that the rest of the country is following — social distancing (self-isolation), hand washing, mask wearing, etc. — it’s important to shore up proper testing to improve the data that is driving decisions and policy regarding our collective response to the disease. Many reports are coming out that death rates and infection rates are skewed and unreliable based on inadequate testing, backlogs, cause of death attribution errors and lagging methods for identifying the virus when patients may have already obtained natural immunity (especially if asymptomatic).
The greatest benefit, however, comes from better positioning ourselves to track immunity to COVID-19 in an effort to restore our economy and our way of life as we know it. By understanding to what extent a given population is immune to the disease (especially in advance of an artificial driver of these metrics, such as a vaccine), we can:
Better predict future presentation (and mitigation)
Establish herd immunity baselines
Focus return-to-work efforts and resumed public gatherings in a responsible manner
Help bolster population health in an informed way — focusing campaigns on gut immunity, continuing efforts to reduce the comorbidities complicating COVID cases, etc.
Positioning ourselves to respond quickly and strategically to this virus — and any others that are inevitable to come in its wake in the coming years — utilizing the very tools already in place for our front-line defenders (physicians, nurses, etc.) will go a long way in shortening the timeline from chaos to confidence.

Leveraging Business Intelligence for COVID-19 Screening
April 1, 2020
314e Employee
Data Analytics
There are many opportunities in healthcare IT that have been exponentially embraced as our entire world faces an unprecedented health crisis. Anything digital (such as
Digital Learning for Healthcare Training
) or something that supports medicine practiced at arm’s length (or six-feet-apart, to be technical) is gaining traction as PPE quantities dwindle and the Coronavirus infection rates skyrocket. We’re collectively learning to be nimble and to utilize the virtual tools available to us to stay safe while caring for the incredible volume of patients at risk. However, one of the biggest tools available to us resides within the breadth of data available in hospital and health system EHRs. Imagine if we could leverage Business Intelligence (“BI”) for healthcare delivery to proactively find patients at risk, screen them before they even walk through the door, and start to plan ahead for population health trends from a data-driven perspective.
If only…
Healthcare BI is Available Right Now
The reality is that
Healthcare Business Intelligence
is here now and available to anyone with a decent data set on their patients or local demographics. Creating a strategy around COVD-19 containment largely makes sense at a local level as community hospitals and health systems know their unique needs and geographic variables better than anyone else. For example, targeting smokers (as recorded via social history in Epic) may not be as fruitful for a suburban facility with a largely health-conscious population; whereas measuring (via social surveys or some other virtual method of information gathering) recent travel and volume of social interactions within the last quarter may yield more meaningful data for clinical outreach.
Eventually, Proactivity will be Possible with COVID-19
Right now, the idea of proactively doing anything associated with COVID-19 (aside from
Social Distancing
) seems far fetched. Many areas are knee deep in positive cases of Coronavirus and feeling the deep pains of too many patients with far too few resources. It’s overwhelming on every front and it seems this thing will never be manageable. But we can see from those who’ve
battled Corona before the U.S.
, the curve will go down. Eventually. All the more reason healthcare administrators and population health experts can start to brainstorm methods for implementing Business Intelligence solutions to better prepare for future outbreaks of Novel Coronavirus (such as a potential resurgence this fall), as well as any other contagions or circumstances that may come.
Collecting a new Kind of Patient Data to Make Business Intelligence More Powerful
We are largely limited at this point on not only the availability of already-taxed healthcare resources but on the difficulty of gathering the right data fast enough to make COVID-19 specific BI totally robust. However, there are useful data points that could be leveraged to anticipate trends and assign a risk score of sorts to the local community. Where the real opportunity comes is realizing just how many factors were at play in this outbreak — from travel and social exposure to underlying conditions and pharmaceutical correlations — and starting to build out a patient questionnaire that paints a more complete picture of who hospitals serve in their communities.
We can’t anticipate every set of variables for every possible disease out there, but data is extremely powerful. The more we gather, the more we can learn to serve those who need us most with healthcare Business Intelligence.

The Vital Role that HIEs can Play in Disease Control and Outbreak Management
March 26, 2020
314e Employee
Interoperability
Our world has changed. (How’s that for an understatement?) We’re collectively watching and waiting as the Coronavirus Pandemic is impacting our entire world, and many are feeling the pressure of uncertainty for both our health and our economic futures. The lasting impacts and true cost of this outbreak are yet to be determined, but we’re simultaneously learning a lot about what our healthcare system can and cannot support. National governments are looking to other countries to watch for patterns in disease rate and come up with the best possible recommendations to reduce the spread and severity of COVID-19. It’s worthwhile in times like these to consider how valuable an interconnected healthcare technology solution would be that gives policy makers and critical care leaders the ability to drive action based on data. Today we’re going to step back from the breaking news for a minute to consider what role Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) could play in disease control for future outbreaks or disasters.
HIEs: Connecting Longitudinal EHR Data Across Geographic Boundaries
Many large health systems have
implemented EHRs like Epic
to allow for continuity of care across a fixed community of healthcare providers. There are case studies and amazing examples of population health management success and improved patient outcomes under this model, but the ability to move the needle is obviously going to be limited to the reach of the sponsoring system. The game-changing benefit of integrating EHRs with HIEs is that providers across communities can share patient data, can exchange real-time communication and can gain access to a new level of visibility for the whole care plan of their patients…even if they leave the health system or go out of town.
A Long Road to a National HIE Solution
There are many in the healthcare IT world who are jaded at this point when it comes to considering a national HIE solution. It sounds amazing, but the complexity and politics to bring that to fruition are enough to make us shrug our shoulders and just focus on regional opportunities as the best option. It’s complex; agreeing on vendors, approach, security, consent, and more is the only way to proceed. This can be daunting enough to accomplish within a single hospital. However, it’s in times of social and medical crisis such as the current COVID-19 outbreak that remind us that the greater good begs us to press forward and do the hard work, have the hard conversations, and chase down unity.
How HIEs can Help Detect Disease Patterns
It’s important to realize that Health Information Exchanges are not an end in and of themselves, but are a means to a new kind of healthcare. Some HIEs on the market offer superior tools, workflows and Clinical Decision Support capability. But where HIEs become invaluable is in their ability to consolidate, normalize and de-duplicate patient data so that we are able to track a single patient — correctly — across the care continuum. From their yearly visit to their PCP, to their recent urgent care visit for a cough, to the subsequent phone calls to their PCP that symptoms are taking a turn, all that activity is tracked real time for prompt identification of symptom presentation that would warrant further testing (and possible quarantine).
The Role of Big Data in Putting Interoperable EHRs and HIEs into Actionable Intel
Big Data in Healthcare
makes incredible trending and analytics possible without individual health systems relying on Data Analysts who are often limited to a certain set of data (within their own repositories). HIEs, and their numerous EHR integrations, can power Big Data opportunities that would make symptom tracking, identifying diagnosis patterns and potentially even containment strategies possible…and quick, at that.
Current Events as Motivation to Continue the Pursuit of Robust HIEs
We’re not there yet. But, the unfolding presentation of COVID-19 is a reminder that we benefit from sharing medical information…across states, countries and nations. It’s a sensitive topic and not something that can be rushed, but we have a perfect example in play of how robust HIEs (even if just regional) could fuel decisions made by national and global leaders to help us all stay safe and get the care we need on time.

What is Staff Augmentation in Healthcare IT?
July 15, 2020
314e Employee
Staff Augmentation
We have undoubtedly entered a new era in work styles and employment opportunities. From the “Gig Economy” to the COVID-19 pandemic, to the prevalence of work-from-home/remote positions, the days of working for a single employer, in an office, for the majority of one’s career are behind us…for better or worse. Careers in healthcare IT are not immune, and in fact, more and more experts in technology solutions for hospitals are embracing the changing tides and opting for consultative work and contract opportunities, including staff augmentation work. So what exactly is
staff augmentation
? We hear that a lot in healthcare IT, from large hospital systems to private clinical practices, and it’s worth making sense of what staff aug is (and what it isn’t), how it can benefit healthcare clients, and how to best leverage this unique arrangement to hire some of the best and brightest minds in the industry.
Staff Augmentation as a Lifestyle Choice for Seasoned Healthcare IT Experts
Before we dive into the practical benefits of a staff augmentation model for hospitals, it’s important to understand why someone would opt for non-traditional employment. Typically, contractors or even direct-hire resources are available for staff augmentation work by choice. They’re not between jobs; staff aug
is
their job. Articles and research abound regarding the benefits of opting out of the long days, stuck behind a desk, slogging away at the same task for days on end. Instead, many healthcare IT professionals take the experience gained from conventional positions and either deepen their knowledge to become masters in a given skill set (such as
EHR implementation project management
), or they continue to broaden their experience to become a jack(or jill)-of-all-trades. Regardless, a decision is made to become a staff augmentation resource of value for the purpose of marketing themselves as an expert-for-hire.
What does this Mean for Healthcare IT Clients?
The wonderful benefit to clients who hire independent experts is that you’re getting a fresh set of eyes, incredible experience with a variety of clients and applications and the flexibility to utilize a pro for as long or as little as needed. Hospitals can buckle under the pressure and costs of carrying a full-time team of healthcare IT experts to manage their network, infrastructure, cybersecurity,
EHR interfaces
, special projects and more. So how much more effective is it for everyone to tap into the most experienced resources out there, just as needed?
The terms of the relationship are flexible and designed to make sense for both the client and the resource. It’s a win-win, and for those willing to embrace this new model of employment, it can pay dividends in IT projects that stay on schedule and snafus avoided by having
the right people in the right seats
Staff Augmentation for Health Technology Clients
Staff augmentation refers to hiring resources for specific terms and tasks based on a need. This may take the form of a year-long contract, a direct-hire arrangement, an on-call backup, or many other combinations of people, time and money. Staff augmentation may be budgeted against a SOW for a stated period of time, or occurs in such ad hoc means as a flat rate per outreach and response. The key point is that it’s between the client and the healthcare IT professional/staffing firm to determine what is needed and how to come to an arrangement to exchange expertise for need, specific to a problem that needs to be solved or a project that needs to be executed.
The Challenge of Finding Good Healthcare IT Resources in an Age of Remote Work
Hiring full-time staff is difficult and, honestly, increasingly difficult for health systems as many of the best developers, DevOps, testers and project managers are enticed by contract work and favor staff augmentation assignments to support their lifestyle. For example, many developers have spent years working from home (or wherever else they choose) because of how common that is in IT. The idea of commuting to an office, donning business casual and sitting in a cubicle is not attractive to many of these folks. This is a serious barrier for attracting the best talent available, which is ultimately what every administrator wants. Specialists in cybersecurity, as another example, are able to name their terms and are far less likely to become a W-2 employee; instead, they prefer to remain 1099 contractors who can work against a given arrangement for a fixed period of time, while still working with other clients or pursuing their interests (professional or otherwise).
A Mindset Shift to Embrace Staff Augmentation for Hospitals
Admittedly, it’s a significant shift in mindset for hospitals accustomed to the traditional model of employment and operations. There may be security concerns with offsite work, while some may see the opportunity to minimize physical presence near medical records and the like for resources who have no need to access PHI. Regardless, there’s a sea of fantastic resources available for hire for those organizations that are willing to embrace the trend and view staff augmentation as a premium benefit for their healthcare IT projects.

Why Physician Champions are Critical for Successful Epic Go-Lives
July 8, 2020
314e Employee
EHR Services
The worlds of technology and medicine probably couldn’t seem further apart, but with the advancements in patient care and population health management via healthcare IT, that gap is closing. What isn’t quickly closing, however, is the understanding of what it takes to implement healthcare IT and what it takes to use that technology to care for patients. Developers rarely speak clinical, and physicians rarely speak tech. This is a disparity that simply
cannot
be overlooked, lest your
Epic go-live
meet a gruesome and expensive fate. Enter: The Physician Champion. We cannot overstate the importance of this role for supporting EHR Go-Lives for large health systems, and today we’ll examine a few reasons for embracing this pivotal player on the implementation team.
What is a Physician Champion and What do They do?
The job of a designated
Physician Champion
is to serve as the liaison between the technical resources hired to build, test and deliver the technology component (such as an EHR or HIE), and the clinical end users who will be expected to adopt the new solution into their daily practice. There are no shortage of details and tasks to make this happen, including:
Drive workflow enhancements
Encourage buy-in from hospital staff, executives, stakeholders
Expectation management
Focus groups to gather benchmark metrics and requirements
Functional testing
Translate clinical needs to health IT opportunities
…Consider the Physician Champion the insurance policy for successful Epic go-live.
Not only is this person — or persons, if you’re fortunate — going to help build the best possible solution for delivering patient care, but they’ll often also serve as
early adopters
Who Should Play the Role of Physician Champion for Epic Implementations?
The right fit for this role may somewhat vary based on the client. For example, if the health system is largely focused on acute care, then an ED-based MD may be a prime candidate to best speak to the nature of the care provided. But a few elements that consistently make for an ideal candidate are:
Available (and responsive) for feedback and implementation support
EHR savvy
Experience with previous healthcare technology implementations
Grasp of organizational goals and how Epic fits into those plans
Keen understanding of HIPAA, HITRUST (if applicable), and other regulatory requirements for dealing with ePHI
Respect from peers / ability to influence users and administrators
Understanding of health IT best practices (such as CPOE, template usage, etc.)
By tapping a natural leader, well-respected in their field, the job of the
Epic implementation
team gets a heck of a lot easier.
The Risk of Trusting the Wrong Champion to Drive Epic Adoption
Looking at this flip side of this role, if you’ve got the wrong resource in this seat, the team — and project as a whole — could be headed for a train wreck. We’ve seen bright physicians hired to fulfill this need based on their availability and zeal for the project, but at the end of the day, their understanding of EHRs and the development process was woefully under calculated. On the other hand, we’ve also witnessed tech-savvy doctors with all the right skills to bring a solid product to end users, but their clinical responsibilities preclude the kind of involvement necessary to actually make use of those skills.
One of the wisest moves that an Epic Project Manager could make is to recognize when the right resources — in any role — are not sitting in the right seat. The Physician Champion is certainly no exception, and failing to address concerns when this vital team member isn’t performing could lead to a false sense of security and, ultimately, an expensive implementation effort that never lands or provides value.

3 Ways to Optimize Epic Training
July 1, 2020
314e Employee
EHR Services
Given the breadth and depth of information required to successfully train clinical staff on an EHR, it’s important to embrace opportunities to make training as effective as possible. There are many adult learning best practices that apply to EHR training, but today we’re going to focus on a few that will provide tons of value and are easy to implement. These three tips for optimizing
Epic training
will support a strong go-live and encourage participation from the busy clinicians and ancillary staff who will utilize the tool.
We often think that more is better, but when it comes to healthcare IT training, less is more. Sure, there’s no shortage of content to cover, so this may feel like a tall order. However, finding ways to focus on the most important information and distilling all the possible workflows and functionality to the most critical will absolutely help users adapt to the EHR more readily. In fact, focusing on the main components first and even providing a simple crosswalk for how the user experience varies from existing technology can set the stage for future training sessions or modules (which we’ll discuss further in a moment).
Short-form content for Epic training breaks apart a massive body of knowledge and filters down to what is most critical for a nurse, physician, intake specialist, etc., to get their respective jobs done. Expecting busy adults to sit for hours and hours on end with non-stop information coming at them isn’t realistic. There’s a lot to cover, and we’ll get to how we accomplish the full spectrum of topics to use Epic well. But cramming content into a lengthy training session under the guise of “one and done” doesn’t actually serve anyone.
Since we have established that shorter, focused training classes are ideal for adult learning (and peer sanity), the key for still hitting all the important functionality for the EHR is to offer topic-based modules. This offers more easily-consumable, bite sized training opportunities to reduce information overload and better accommodate crammed clinical schedules. Not to mention, the modular approach to Epic training makes remedial review when needed very simple and far more efficient than executing another whole class.
Digital Learning Modules for Effective EHR Training
The best way to ensure end users obtain consistent information and have easy access to EHR training content is to leverage
digital learning (eLearning)
for Epic training. By creating a library of training topics to cover all the critical functionality, as well as resource-specific workflows, EHR trainers can better meet clinical users exactly where they are and still deliver excellent instruction. The digital learning medium is a slam dunk option for satisfying both the shorter duration recommendation, as well as the modular approach.
We are absolutely not opposed to offering incentives or spicing up the implementation process with perks and rewards to encourage EHR adoption. However, it’s no big surprise that learning happens most organically when
intrinsic motivation
is established and cultivated. By honoring the importance of the internal ownership and value association that comes with intrinsic motivation, Epic trainers can optimize their instruction and the outcomes. When clinical end users understand why they’re learning Epic, what the benefits are of using the solution and how the tool will benefit
their
core tasks, they’re far more likely to actively participate in the training sessions and retain what they’re learning.
One of the challenges associated with Epic training is that the end users are inherently more busy and less technologically savvy than other IT implementations (or at the very least, of varying skill levels). By breaking training content into less lengthy sessions organized by subject/workflow and conveying value to inspire participation, EHR trainers can overcome many of the challenges that preclude a successful

3 Advantages of EHR Digital Learning for Large Health Systems
May 27, 2020
314e Employee
EHR Services
When it comes to training for EHR implementations at large health systems, the logistics involved with rolling out new technology (or even updates) is enough to push even detail-oriented folks over the edge. Securing physical space, attendance and qualified trainers to ensure all clinical and administrative staff are appropriately trained to support new healthcare IT is a lot of work. Consider, then, the incredible benefits of employing
digital learning to support EHR implementation
The budget associated with
EHR training
is an area of the implementation project plan that is often subject to push back…usually from those who have yet to experience the fallout of a poorly-planned training effort. Knowing that cost is always an element of concern for health systems trying to leverage new technology; it’s worth noting the effectiveness of EHR digital learning to help reduce budget. While the actual production and preparation of training materials may be slightly higher on the front end, the delivery and execution of the e-learning modules is far more streamlined and requires fewer resources than traditional classroom training.
Classroom Training isn’t Dead
While we absolutely sing the praises of digital learning, especially for large organizations with a lot of busy clinical staff, it’s worth remembering that classroom training should still be leveraged. If the perception of the EHR implementation or looming new technology is extremely negative, it may backfire for hospital administrators to offer a less personal touchpoint for a step as important as training. Live trainers are harder to ignore or shut off, versus video. It’s also vital to ensure that all resources have adequate access to the material, so for less tech savvy users who may struggle with the self-service approach of e-learning resources, offering a limited classroom training option may help health systems best serve their full employee base.
Another powerful aspect of the digital learning approach to EHR training is the ability for the training curriculum to scale. Whereas arranging for full-blown classroom training for a large user base is cumbersome and logistically challenging (especially when coupled with competing clinical responsibilities and schedules), rolling out a one-and-done e-learning module is a limited effort for unlimited payoff. Clinical staff can interact with the material at their convenience, as often as needed, and staff turnover is no longer a source of grief (at least not on the EHR training front).
Let’s repeat again: staff can interact with the training material as often as needed. This is a big deal! Very often, training sessions are packing a lot of information into a single, hefty session. Digital learning, on the other hand, generally consists of fewer, shorter videos or modules, allowing users to revisit areas of interest or functionality with which they’re struggling. Even if you plan to offer
at-the-elbow support during go-live
(which we highly recommend!), providing the opportunity for trainees to circle back on the breadth of information presented during EHR training as needed is a huge benefit for scaling and encouraging mastery.
Perhaps a more rarely considered benefit of the EHR digital learning approach is the ability to present the training material consistently. Without a variety of trainers and styles, hospitals can eliminate the kind of variance that may result in inconsistent readiness amongst users. This also paves the way for accountability for all end users; administrators know that everyone received the
same
information, and therefore gaps can be isolated to resources or departments that may simply need additional help (versus a systemic problem with the training as a whole).
Utilizing a fixed approach to training also creates a fair opportunity to measure mastery of the EHR functionality. In traditional classroom training approaches, we’ve heard that performance outcomes (of users) varies quite a bit, resulting in a slower launch. When every resource receives consistent information (and access to that information), however, monitoring aptitude via tests and quizzes becomes a fair standard for intercepting areas of concern before scheduled go-live.

The Importance of Progress Metrics for Epic Go-Live Support
June 3, 2020
314e Employee
EHR Services
Rolling out a new instance of Epic is a big deal. It takes a lot of resources and time to implement EHRs into large health systems, so it’s vital that the proper steps are taken to encourage utilization and support long-term adoption. Best laid plans won’t do much good, however, without real data to measure progress. Today we’re going to share the importance of both establishing and measuring progress metrics for
Epic go-live
What Does Epic Go-Live Support Look Like?
For starters, it’s important to grasp exactly what happens during an EHR go-live. If executed well, training and socialization to the idea and purpose of Epic’s arrival happen well before launch day. Typically, most hospitals will choose a well-publicized day to begin the roll-out period, knowing that it takes more than a day to gain real traction and for clinical end users to feel comfortable enough to operate independently on their new tool and with the same efficiency as before the change.
Classic at-the-elbow (ATE) support for
Epic implementations
consists of highly skilled trainers or account managers who are circulating the floors and departments to answer questions, collect feedback and quickly resolve major hurdles unanticipated during project planning. A command center is established to centralize support — administrative, technical and others — to address issues and complaints so that progress can continue and lessons can be quickly learned.
Establishing Progress and Success Metrics for Epic Implementation
During this critical time of go-live, it’s wise for health systems to work with their support team (whether internal or hired for the project) to determine what metrics will reflect success and progress during the implementation of Epic. For example, is picking up the pace as reflected by more patient records closed by end-of-day a valuable trend to track? Or perhaps, in the case of a cutover, is the percentage of users fully utilizing the new instance a metric to drive forward? An organization must work with their implementation team to think about early on what the goals are and how they can measure them during go-live. Without this data, it can be easy to think that things are going better (or worse) than anticipated, which doesn’t often translate to long-term success. It’s far too haphazard to hope for the best when the resources and budget involved in an undertaking like this are on the line.
Measuring Success of an Epic Implementation
Just as establishing qualifications for calling an Epic go-live successful are unique to a healthcare entity, so too are the ways in which those metrics are monitored and evaluated. But the important thing is to
do it
Press forward with intention and a plan, and all the work leading up to an Epic go-live will pay off as the dust settles.

How COVID-19 will Change the Face of Digital Learning for Healthcare IT
May 20, 2020
314e Employee
EHR Services
It’s hard to imagine looking for the bright side of COVID-19 as we continue to adjust our lifestyles to reduce the spread of this virus. However, it’s worth considering how the unique variables of this unprecedented time may impact our future in unexpected ways. The embracing of virtual communication in light of social distancing and stay at home orders has brought unexpected demographics “online,” often for the first time ever. Elderly couples have learned the ins-and-outs of Zoom to stay in touch with grandchildren, resettled refugees are tapping into the internet at home for the first time ever, and many are finding innovative ways to run their business and teams without being in the same room. The benefit of all of this to the future of healthcare IT is an openness to
digital learning for EHR training
, as an example. Digital learning offers a myriad of opportunities to health systems to more efficiently deliver training to a wide audience of clinical staff, and in the wake of a global pandemic, this method of adult learning for healthcare will likely be the primary method for the foreseeable future.
Streamlined Logistics with EHR Digital Learning
When the goal is to get busy physicians, nurses and support staff up to speed on the latest and greatest for Epic, many hospitals used to opt for classroom training. While the attentiveness of live, in-person training sessions can be valuable, there are significant benefits to choosing digital learning for Epic training, such as:
Ability for attendees to self-pace
Consistency of material presented
Ease of scheduling
Efficient trainer booking/utilization
Lower costs
No capacity concerns
Reduced downtime for clinical attendees
Scalability
Digital Learning is Exponentially Efficient for Clinical Professionals
As you can see, given the specific users impacted by
EHR training for Epic
, the benefits of digital learning are exponentially realized for this high-demand group. Health systems would be wise to capitalize on the uptick in telemedicine and teleconferencing during the COVID-19 pandemic to establish a new way of rolling out information regarding Epic and other hospital updates.
While there may otherwise be some push-back to online learning methods, the current healthcare crisis has opened the door for a willingness to leverage virtual means for the sake of preserving health and reducing potential harm. This opportunity allows the benefits discussed above to be realized by new populations, and will perhaps be one of the unexpected good things to come of the novel Coronavirus outbreak.
On-Demand Digital Learning for Epic Supports Physician End-Users
One benefit of digital learning that cannot be overstated is the incredible value of the ability for physician end users to interact with EHR training modules on their own schedule. Because rounding schedules and clinic hours are less than standard, especially right now, offering digital learning content that can be accessed whenever and wherever doctors are on a given day is huge, especially when trying to drive participation within a fixed timeframe.
Digital Learning Best Practices for Healthcare Professionals
By following
adult digital learning best practices
, health systems can develop (or delegate development and execution to professional training consultants) bite-sized videos or articles for communicating important information about Epic upgrades, hospital initiatives, etc. Digital training modules are far more successful in terms of engagement and mastery because they avoid a hefty time commitment, which coincides with a drop off in interest and attentiveness. Incorporating interactive aspects, such as quizzes or “hands on” practice, throughout the training session will also encourage mastery of the subject matter and improve the likelihood that learners will continue to the end.
Giving respected healthcare professionals the ability to manage their own schedule for Epic training goes a long way for getting the type of participation hospitals must see in order to realize the benefits of adoption, as well as honors the time and responsibilities that physicians carry. Meeting learners where they are with digital learning for healthcare IT is a significant way that we can get traction for EHR implementation efforts, especially during a stressful season such as this.

How Training Initiatives Helped Empower and Prepare Baylor Scott & White Health for COVID-19 (Part 1)
April 22, 2020
314e Employee
EHR Services
Jerrie Rankin, VP of Operational Informatics with Baylor Scott & White Health and Nicholas Edwards, Senior Manager Enterprise Technical Training and Support, Baylor Scott & White Health join CHIME Media for a podcast to talk about how training initiatives helped empower and prepare their teams for the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ryan Seratt, Director of Training with 314e chats with Jerrie and Nicholas about this project, as 314e is a partners with their team.
The following is Part 1 of 3 blog posts that follow the full transcript of the recent CHIME Media podcast.

Ryan Seratt:
Hello and welcome to the podcast. My name is Ryan Seratt and I’m the Director of Digital Training for 314e Corporation. Today we’re speaking with two training leaders from Baylor Scott and White health about how recent training initiatives have played a major role in preparing, empowering and redirecting staff resources to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. I’d like to introduce you to Jerrie Rankin. Jerrie has over 27 years of experience as a physician practice leader and is currently the Vice President of Operation Informatics at Baylor Scott & White Health. She is the enterprise organizational strategic liaison for system informatics, the executive operational bridge to technical teams. She’s responsible for the alignment of technical EHR training teams across the system and provider and end user proficiency leadership.
Also with us is Nicholas Edwards, a senior Training Manager with Baylor Scott & White Health. He’s been with Baylor Scott & White Health for the last nine years and has led the implementation of computer-based training throughout the system. In addition, Nick has led the initiative of the EHR and other technology at several organizations and has extensive background in developing innovative training solutions, instructional design and workflow redesign and lean methodology. Having worked with Nick over the last year, I can see how he incorporates that lean thinking into a lot of his decisions. We’re excited to have you both with us today. Welcome. Thank you.
Jerrie, could you please tell us a little bit about Baylor Scott & White Health?
Baylor Scott & White Health Overview
Jerrie Rankin:
Sure, I’d be happy to give you a quick overview. So, Baylor Scott & White Health is the largest not for profit health care system in Texas. We have over 50 hospitals, ambulatory clinics, surgery centers and pharmacies; we even have a health plan. So, you name it, we are a complete health care system. To put it in perspective, our geographic spread is basically the size of the entire state of Indiana. We have over 49,000 employees and we work with around 7,500 physicians.
EHR Training During COVID-19
Ryan Seratt:
Oh, that’s a big footprint. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted so many aspects of our lives right now, both personally and professionally. We’ve all heard about healthcare organizations that are struggling to adequately staff their ICUs and other departments that are providing care to affected patients. Many organizations are trying to find ways to effectively communicate changes and to train their staff, but it’s hard to bring people together to address problems when everyone has to be six feet apart. However, that isn’t what’s happening at Baylor Scott & White Health and why we’re here to speak with you today.
Jerrie, can you tell us about your solution? How has Baylor Scott & White Health been able to effectively communicate changes and updates to the end users to support the organization’s COVID-19 response?
Jerrie Rankin:
Yes, I’d be happy to. So, what’s surprising about our solution is that we were already preparing for something like this over the past 18 months and we didn’t even realize it. You know, none of us knew we were coming on a pandemic. And as we were working on this, we did not know that we would be in a situation where we would need to communicate policy and system changes on a daily basis very quickly, and sometimes hourly. Also, we would have to be able to flex in such a way that would allow us to quickly cross train end users to meet the needs of the organization. So, I said we were already prepared. So how did we do it? First of all, I want to start by explaining a little bit about the team. The team that did this work is our enterprise technical training and support team. We are informatics; we are not IS. We can collaborate really well with IS. We communicate with them on a daily basis and have a great working relationship. But, us being an informatics gives us the ability to be closer to the business because we really are the bridge between operations and the technology.
Epic Training: Computer-Based Platforms
Jerrie Rankin:
The training team being positioned in informatics has ensured our training program has been a priority. And because of that, we were positioned well to transition to computer-based training modules. So basically, over the last 18 months, we have replaced all of our instructor-led training with computer-based training. I have to tell you that when we started on this journey, we got some pushback. Internally people that were like, well, ‘you can’t do away with instructor led.’ But, we knew that we had to be scalable for our geographic size and our team member size.
We’re a big territory and we have a huge headcount. It’s important for us to be able to deliver the training quickly, because the business wants it quickly and also consistently across the entire enterprise. In doing our computer-based training planning, we contracted with Ancile. Ancile is our vendor to help us implement uPerform. uPerform is a content management system that has content development, as well as content deployment. This platform worked really well for us in developing our computer-based training. All of that was in place when this COVID-19 thing came. We were able to quickly develop cross training curriculum from what we had already developed to meet the needs of our business because our resources were being asked to go support the ICU go support Ed go from outpatient to impatient. So, by having that computer-based training already complete, we were able to flex very quickly, which helped us be prepared for our COVID-19 training needs.
COVID-19 Button Within Epic
Jerrie Rankin:
We weren’t necessarily prepared for the communication challenges that were to come, and maybe we didn’t even realize this. But, I’m happy to say that our team was able to rise to those challenges because of the groundwork that we had already laid. We were able to leverage uPerform even more to provide an on-demand access to critical information via two different access points within Epic. Organizationally, like all other organizations, we have a ton of ways to communicate with each other. We do it through Teams, we do it through WebEx, we have Zoom, we have SharePoint sites. There are almost too many ways.
Our end users get bombarded from a lot of different angles, so our goal was to cut through all that noise to provide a one stop shop for information. The changes come daily, and sometimes multiple times a day. We wanted our end users to have access to the most updated information when it was happening. We accomplished this by leveraging uPerform to put a COVID-19 button in the patient header right within their normal workflow. And that came from the content deployment part of u Perform, something that we were getting ready to start exploring anyway. What this did was this drove everyone to one place. We don’t have to worry, or they don’t have to worry, about misplaced emails or rifling through tip sheets or hunting down SharePoint sites. They are able to just click a button right in their workflow and get the resources they need.
Additionally, we added a video visit button in that workflow; we’ll talk about that a little bit later in the podcast. But one of the things, Ryan, that I really want to point out is the differentiator here is that this training team has a very small and mighty technical team. We are able to bring technology solutions straight to the business. We don’t have to filter through a robust IS approval process which is necessary, especially for an organization our size and we work with on a routine basis. But in this particular situation, we were able to take that technology solution straight to the business quickly. We would not have been able to do that without having this small mighty technical team on our training side.

COVID-19 Concerns Drive Virtual Training Adoption
March 23, 2020
314e Employee
EHR Services
Together, we are facing a global health environment that we have never seen before. The COVID-19 virus is not only impacting the health and wellbeing of our patient populations, but it is disrupting the way we interact, connect, and educate ourselves. Those of us on the frontline of healthcare delivery must be prepared for all scenarios. More importantly than ever before, technology allows us to stay connected with each other despite physical restrictions.
In situations like this, virtual training provides the remote capabilities and solutions that are increasingly important. The primary strength of virtual training is that students are not restricted to a single location. Improvements in internet speeds and in the tools themselves over the last few years makes virtual training a reliable training method with a strong future. Every training delivery modality has advantages and unique challenges that need to be accounted for to create the best and most effective experience for the learner. For outstanding virtual training, effective planning around these three areas will increase the effectiveness of your training:
The Virtual Environment
Student Engagement
Using the Technology
The Virtual Environment
When you think of the traditional classroom, you think of a room that is specifically purposed for training groups of 10-20 people and that is free of any distractions. This allows people to focus on learning what is being presented so they can perform the job that is needed. The virtual classroom is very different and in the virtual classroom people may be attending the class from the comfort of a designated home office, they could be sitting on their couch, or they can be physically anywhere on a personal device.
You should consider that COVID-19 may have even affected the real-life environment your learner finds themselves in. They may not be alone as children sent home from school and significant others telecommuting themselves may unintentionally be competing for attention. People who frequently work remotely know how to overcome distractions, but people new to working remotely may need additional training on how to effectively navigate their new environment.
Tip: Break It Up
Virtual training requires extra focus by the participants and instructors. More frequent breaks will help your learners pay attention and increase knowledge retention. Suggested: 10 minute breaks every 50 minutes.
Here is a timer on YouTube that you can use.
Student Engagement
In a traditional classroom environment, a presenter is able to read the faces and the body language of the people in the class. Instructors know when everyone is following along or when they lose somebody. In a virtual setting, new presenters often feel uncomfortable with the lack of visual feedback. However, this can easily be overcome with use of the chat feature.
One of the best techniques to interact with the class is through the chat feature. Just like an instructor would in a regular classroom, the class can be asked a simple question and instead of responding vocally the students are asked to respond in the chatroom. This ensures the students are engaged and participating in their learning. We know active students that are required to think learn more and retain more information than if they were passively listening.
Virtual training instructors should ensure they know how to use all the included interaction tools to fully engage their classes. Most software will include white boards, breakout rooms, desktop control (pass the mouse), annotations and digital hand raising, among others. Several solutions have an attention tracking feature that notifies you when the students screen is not focused on the conference software.
“Don’t tell when you can show” is a key training concept that is even more important in the virtual setting. Instead of describing something show a picture, a diagram or a video. The most effective PowerPoint slides contain key ideas and graphics without a lot of other text. If you are training EHR software like Epic, launch into the software and teach through the examples is also a powerful practice.
Tip: Chat Response Time
Wait for it – It takes a little longer for people to respond in the chat to answer a question than what you would normally experience in a classroom. People tend to think about their response more and then need to type it out.
Using the Technology
The virtual training instructor needs to have the right equipment and software set-up to have a successful webinar.
Sound quality matters and nothing will derail a virtual EHR training as quickly as a sound issue. It’s recommended that the instructor use an external microphone, as the quality of the built-in laptop microphone is not good enough for virtual training. A desktop microphone or even a good quality set of ear buds will greatly improve the trainers voice for the students.
Before each class, the instructor should test their software and microphone to ensure that everything is functioning properly. This can usually be accomplished by signing into the virtual room and completing a sound check. Students also need to test their equipment before class to avoid last minute problems. By being proactive and requiring students to install the conference software ahead of the class, you can drastically reduce last minute technical issues that will often result in missing the virtual class.
Tip: Testing 1,2,3
Instructors and student should test their system before the class to reduce last minute issues.

Conclusion: Virtual Classrooms During COVID-19 Pandemic
With so many unknowns around how the COVID-19 pandemic will affect learning in the future, many health systems are a exploring distance learning alternatives. Virtual Classrooms can be an effective alternative to the physical classroom.

3 Aspects of Epic Implementation that Could be Impacted by COVID-19
April 8, 2020
314e Employee
EHR Services
It’s safe to say at this point that there is no aspect of our collective lives that has not been impacted by COVID-19. Schools are closed and work methods as we know them have drastically changed. We’re being ordered to stay in our homes by local officials and droves of people are overwhelming the healthcare system across the globe with this novel strain of the virus. No industry seems to be untouched, but healthcare is certainly taking the brunt. While those on the frontlines fight to stay well and equipped to deal with this medical crisis, administrators and health infrastructure staff are scrambling to provide timely support and still execute on planned initiatives to benefit providers and patients. It is still possible to follow through with planned healthcare IT projects, but it’s worth acknowledging how
Epic implementation efforts
could be impacted by COVID-19…and to plan accordingly.
Gathering in classrooms is no longer allowed for our nation’s children, and it definitely isn’t going to fly for “voluntary” gatherings like Epic training. Leveraging
Digital Learning for EHR training
is an option here, and the good news is that it’s an incredibly effective method. Even if the plan was an Epic upgrade throughout a given department, it’s worth pressing forward to gain those optimized workflows and resolve any known barriers to utilizing the tool well. Modifying the training to accommodate those not necessarily used to virtual training will help reduce friction, remembering that much of the country is having to do the same thing.
A few tips for making
virtual Epic training
simple and effective:
Acknowledge what is going on, thank attendees for their service, then dive into the content (we’re not robots, after all)
Focus on the most important concepts first
Try to keep the training sessions brief, offering multiple topic-specific sessions if needed (versus one giant lesson)
Use a simple, user-friendly tool that doesn’t require login or a special app
Admittedly, gaining focus is going to be difficult given the current circumstances for the demographic attending training. Accept that, press forward and focus on what is most critical to make Epic implementation as successful as it can be given the variables.
Speaking of focus, one of the challenges that Epic implementation projects face during the Coronavirus crisis is healthcare IT stakeholders being pulled in many different directions to support an uptick in telemedicine, stressed technology solutions given patient volume and potentially even infection with the virus, reducing available support even further. When key stakeholders in an
EHR upgrade
or roll-out project aren’t able to show up — mentally or physically — for planning meetings and execution, the resulting Go-Live will suffer. Be it from subpar requirements, an overly taxed implementation team, lack of coordination with key vendors to support integrations or many other potential whammies, best efforts can’t overcome a lack of buy-in to drive participation and adoption.
Postponing Healthcare IT Initiatives?
If progress on implementing Epic is already in the works, it may serve the organization best to continue as planned, albeit on perhaps a stretched timeline to accommodate expected delays. However, kicking off new healthcare IT initiatives during COVID-19 might be very challenging. Administrators and the project team need to consider the expected benefits or ROIs of the efforts, and decide if they’re feasible in the current climate. In some cases, they may be even more critical and therefore absolutely worth pressing through organizational challenges. This is a decision that should be led with transparency and a firm grasp of what’s viable at the moment, realizing that progress is still possible with some creativity and patience.
The reality is that spoken-for funds for health system initiatives are pretty vulnerable at this point. Unprecedented and unexpected needs are going to shift things around rapidly, and no initiative is really safe. Instead of balking at shifting budgets, it’s worth stepping back to get creative and consider what can be done on a micro budget. Is a forthcoming Epic optimization project going to make addressing patient volume and
unique Coronavirus coding needs
, for example, much more efficient? If so, make your case to health system administrators as a worthwhile investment sooner than later. Are there aspects of the implementation that can move forward — such as lengthy vendor development to support integrations or new standards — until other resources and funds are in a more stable place?
Again, acknowledging the reality of the current healthcare crisis, respecting the priority of certain line items on the budget, and coming to the table with innovative solutions for proceeding on Epic integration efforts with a modified plan may very well save the healthcare IT efforts and still provide value to those bravely on the frontlines.

Coding and Billing for COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Lab Tests, and What’s Next
March 18, 2020
314e Employee
Revenue Cycle Services
At a time when millions of people in the US are wondering about possibly getting tested for COVID-19 symptoms, thousands of medical service providers are looking for answers on how to code and bill for these tests. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) took proactive actions and recently announced two HCPCS (Healthcare Common Procedural Coding System) codes that can be used by laboratories to bill for COVID-19 diagnostic tests.
President Trump declared COVID-19 as a National Emergency. He said that this declaration will “open up access” to $50 bn federal funds to fight COVID-19. He also said that the declaration would allow HHS (Health and Human Services) to make necessary laws or bypass existing ones to allow “maximum flexibility” to care providers, doctors and hospitals. President Trump said that 1.4 million COVID-19 test kits will be available within a week and about 5 million will be available within the next month.
Which codes can you use for Coronavirus?
The first HCPCS Code U0001, can be used to bill for tests and to track new cases of the virus. This code is used specifically for CDC testing laboratories to test patients for SARS-CoV-2.The second HCPCS Code U0002, announced on 5-Mar-2020, allows labs to bill for non-CDC laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV (COVID-19. It should be noted that FDA had allowed certain labs to develop their own validated COVID-19 diagnostics on 29-Feb-2020. U0002 may be used for tests developed by these additional labs when submitting claims to Medicare or other insurers.
When can you start billing for COVID-19?
The Medicare claims processing system will be able to accept these codes starting 1-Apr-2020, for dates of service on or after 4-Feb-2020. Local MACs (Medicare Administrative Contractors) are responsible for developing the payment amount for such claims. Labs are advised to check with the respective MACs on the payable amount for these tests before billing for them. Similar to other lab tests, there is generally no beneficiary cost sharing under Original Medicare.
What’s next?
In addition to the codes, CMS also issued a Medicare Fact Sheet to ensure that Medicare subscribers have a clear understanding on their coverage and benefits. In addition to explaining about Diagnostic tests, Vaccines, Inpatient Hospital Care Services and Quarantines, the one thing that caught my eye was the section on Telehealth.
“Beneficiaries can communicate with their doctors or certain other practitioners without necessarily going to the doctor’s office in person for a full visit”, said the fact sheet. “Doctors and certain practitioners may bill for these virtual check-in services furnished through several communication technology modalities, such as telephone (HCPCS code G2012) or captured video or image (HCPCS code G2010)“, the fact sheet added.
The impetus of the CMS on promoting Telemedicine visits in the current scenario is a welcome one where a suspected patient visiting the doctor is not only putting herself in risk but also the doctor, staff in the clinic and other patients present in the clinic during the visit.
COVID-19 crisis will take months, may be a couple of years to get stabilized, but it will surely change the way we think about our hygiene and infectious diseases. Telemedicine phenomenon seems to be lone beneficiary in the current crisis.

How Training Initiatives Helped Empower and Prepare Baylor Scott & White Health for COVID-19 (Part 2)
April 24, 2020
314e Employee
EHR Services
Part 2 of 3: Jerrie Rankin, VP of Operational Informatics with Baylor Scott & White Health and Nicholas Edwards, Senior Manager Enterprise Technical Training and Support, Baylor Scott & White Health join CHIME Media for a podcast to talk about how training initiatives helped empower and prepare their teams for the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ryan Seratt, Director of Training with 314e chats with Jerrie and Nicholas about this project, as 314e is a partners with their team.
The following is Part 2 of 3 blog posts of the full transcript for our recent CHIME Media podcast.

Leveraging Technology to Solve EHR Training Needs
Ryan Seratt:
Jerrie I think that the way that you’re leveraging technology to solve your training needs is really interesting. Could you provide a little bit more detail about the technical solution? You were speaking about?
Jerrie Rankin:
Yes, absolutely. I’m going to hand it over to Nicholas Edwards. Nick is our technical lead guru. He is our leader of that team and can give you a lot more in-depth knowledge into the technical aspects. Nick, why don’t you take it away.
Nicholas Edwards:
Thanks, Jerrie. We decided to implement Ancile and uPerform in early 2019. uPerform is really three different applications that solve multiple issues for us. First, it’s a content management system. The content management system allows us to curate all of our training materials in one location for both development and distribution purposes.
Ryan Seratt:
Nick, Jerrie also mentioned a content management system. How’s that different than a learning management system that most people are familiar with? Can you describe the difference between the two?
Nicholas Edwards:
Oh yeah, good question. Learning management systems are used to assign training to users and track completion. These are the systems that we use to assign things like Epic training for new hires or annual compliance training. With a content management system, it serves as a central repository for all of our development files as this replaces the old spreadsheets we’ve all used to track the status of content when developing for large projects. It allows us to see when content was last updated, we can assign trainers and SMEs to update that content, manage the different versions of that content and report on all of our development activities. Secondly, u Perform is a content development tool. That is, it can be used to create all of our training artifacts. This includes computer-based training courses with interactive simulation, tip sheets, videos and more. It’s like combining software like Captivate or Storyline or Screen Steps, which is an application used to create tip sheets. Lastly, it is a content deployment application that will actually integrate with Epic to provide context-specific training content via the uPerform learning library. This means we can put links to training materials almost anywhere in Epic. Once the user clicks on the link, content that is specific to that area and that user will appear right there in a user’s workspace.
EHR Training Library
Ryan Seratt:
I think your learning library is new technology that might interest a lot of people. Can you explain the difference between your LMS and your learning library and how they differ?
Nicholas Edwards:
As you may know, we use an LMS to track user completion for new hire training. The learning library is really an upgrade to the old SharePoint site that we and so many other organizations use to store Epic tip sheets. The learning library is really for the end users, and it’s designed to support them in the flow of work. Overall, uPerform is quite a powerful tool and it allowed us, along with our partners from 314e, including you Ryan, to convert all of our instructor led training courses to computer-based training in just six months. That was over 155 plus hour courses, which is an absurd amount of work to get done in that time frame. This is what laid the groundwork for us to begin doing so many cooler things with uPerform.
Ryan Seratt:
What does it take to implement a solution like u Perform, as far as resources and time goes?
Nicholas Edwards:
So, let’s start with the team. I have a somewhat small but mighty team, as Jerrie mentioned. The core of that team consists of three team members, plus me. I have one DBA who set up our user provisioning, which grants our training team and end users access to the content management system and the learning library. This setup is crucial because we’re able to bring in user information from Epic, which allows us to associate training content with our Epic roles and make role-specific training materials available for them in the learning library. This way, physicians and other team members do not have to sort through a long list of documents that do not pertain to them. He also worked with our Citrix team to implement a Citrix redirect for the learning library URL. This is another vital component of the u Perform Epic integration. This setup ensures that virtually no Citrix bandwidth is used as doctors and nurses access training documents, videos or anything else in the learning library, when accessing the u Perform learning library from within Epic. By doing this, we were able to ensure our CMIO and IS leadership that integrating u Perform with Epic would not negatively impact system performance.
The next team member is an instructional designer by trade. She designed all of the templates we use for content development. This allows trainers and SMEs to simply use the content development tool to capture screenshots, do some light editing and produce a professionally designed course tip sheet or videos.
Last but not least, we have a Program Manager who ensures that all content is deployed to the correct location and role. This includes making sure all of our end users are put into groups in u Perform and then making sure the documents are correctly associated with those groups.
EHR Training: Transition from Instructor-Led to Computer-Based Training
Ryan Seratt:
And can you talk a little bit about the efficiencies that you’ve been able to gain with using uPerform?
Nicholas Edwards:
Oh, absolutely. For starters,
we saved over 17,000 hours as we worked with our 314e partners to convert our instructor led training to computer-based training
That is, it would have taken us around 29,000 hours as opposed to 12,000 hours to complete the conversion work with another tool like Captivate or Camtasia. Also, since the tool is easy to use, we were able to incorporate our credential trainers and other SMEs into the work. In short, we were able to effectively crowdsource our instructor led training conversion project. That left us with a large body of trainers who were now familiar with the tool and we haven’t left that large body of trainers sit idle for long at all. They immediately went to work creating tip sheets, training materials for Epic quarterly bundles, special updates and other support materials. In addition, they are providing more at the elbow support, one on one virtual support and performing all kinds of other support activities.

Why Extensive Testing is Non-Negotiable for EHR Interface Implementations
February 26, 2020
314e Employee
Interoperability
One of the biggest shortcomings we’ve seen when it comes to implementing healthcare IT is a lack of good, deep, detailed testing. There is a ton of lift that goes into building interfaces, mapping APIs and getting vendors to agree on a standard for data exchange to get one step closer to coordinated care records. But front-loading
EHR interface efforts
can have disastrous results once the healthcare solution is in the wild, so to speak, if proper space isn’t allotted in the timeline for extensive QA. When every digit and value contributes valuable information to the overall picture of patient health, a hospital system simply can’t afford poor Epic interface work…or more specifically, a lack of comprehensive testing of those EHR interfaces.
Bells and Whistles Won’t Help if They Don’t Work
There is no shortage of promising, flashy new health technology out there that promises to maximize efficiency, make physicians’ lives easier and provide valuable ROI to hospital administrators. But even the best device or wearable is useless if the connectivity between those impressive monitoring agents and the Epic EHR (as the Source of Truth) aren’t reliable and faithful. Imagine a surgeon who relies heavily on patient monitoring devices to keep an eye on his charges post-op — and therefore can stack clinic days a bit heavier given the automation provided by these new tools — only to find that the data packets containing timely updates are not being delivered to the point-of-care as expected. Chaos and panic ensues (as it very well should), and the confidence gained takes several significant steps backward.
Why Confidence Matters When it Comes to Trusting EHR Interfaces
Speaking of confidence, this is an element of this whole endeavor that cannot be understated. Not only is the whole point of testing to ensure a level of confidence for everyone involved, but when technology is implemented that does
not
deliver as promised, the impact felt is generally more significant in terms of perception than if things went
perfectly smooth during go-live
It’s a thankless job, folks, but someone has to do it. Never underestimate the importance of confidence in the technology you’re implementing when it comes to Epic interface work.
Brace for the Unexpected
There’s a sense in healthcare IT that the best testers are those who can
always
find something is wrong. While no one is generally excited to learn that there’s a bug in a key interface, it’s still valuable for Epic project teams to embrace this kind of feedback knowing that each remediation and round of regression testing is one step closer to an ironclad exercise in interoperability. Some of the wisest test cases in a comprehensive Epic interface test plan are to simulate unexpected data or situations in the workflow.
What happens when an expected data element is missing (even if it “should always” be there), especially if it’s required to match the patient record?
How does the system behave when a connected device sends a different format at the behest of an end user action?
Does the connection break down if a transaction is sent twice?
Finding the surprise angles can save a lot of grief from discovering these unsavory loopholes during go-live at the hands of busy clinical users.
Deploying a skilled EHR tester to test the various interfaces and connections ensures that every foreseeable nook and cranny has been evaluated. Of course, there may occur those unforeseen whammies, and it’s just as prudent to expect those as it is to unleash a professional interface tester prior to release. But the better and more detailed the testing prior to launch, the better chances of seeing those EHR interfaces soar with traffic and deliver value to hospitals, clinicians and the patients they serve.

Developing Engaging Content for EHR Training Materials
December 11, 2019
314e Employee
EHR Services
We’ve previously shared some tips for delivering the
best Epic training in the healthcare IT
space, but as the devil is in the details, we’re going to focus in on
EHR training
materials. There are many “out of the box” tools available on this front, usually from the EHR vendors themselves, but when it comes to encouraging adoption for Epic implementation (or any other EHR), it’s a wise move to up the ante and develop custom training materials. The idea isn’t to recycle existing content; on the contrary, offering fresh ways to reach end users so they pay attention, retain training concepts, and take well to the technology are goals that every member for the EHR implementation team should pursue and support. So let’s look specifically at a few approaches that will benefit trainers and trainees alike.
Don’t Underestimate The Power Of A Good EHR Quick Start Guide
While there’s no one who can (in their right mind) argue against the value of in-depth EHR training on systems as complex as Epic, it’s still important to remember that surfacing the most important facts is a great way to reduce the need for re-training and mitigate errors when it comes to
go-live
Utilize Screen Capture Training Videos to Simulate “Hands On”
It’s not exactly news that we’re an increasingly visual culture, so the more that video media can be leveraged for EHR training, the better. And just as we mentioned the value of a brief training guide like the quick start guide above, it’s important to keep training videos on Epic and other healthcare IT solutions short and sweet as well. Experts recommend utilizing a series of video tutorials, 3-5 minutes long, versus one mammoth recording that will be difficult to ingest for busy clinicians. In addition, providing visual content such as screen capture of the EHR application in use with relevant voice over is a great way to simulate hands-on experience, and quickly create familiarity with the UI.
Not only do EHR training videos allow for scalable, consistent instruction, but they’re frankly more likely to reach end users where they are. It can be a logistical nightmare to corral masses of physicians, nurses and other support staff into classroom sessions to support implementation efforts. But EHR training is a critical component on the road to successful adoption, so finding creative solutions to disseminate information will pay dividends.
Incorporate Measurable Checkpoints in EHR Training Materials
How many of us recall the driving motivation for paying attention in class when we were younger as,
“Will this be on the test?”
The value (or threat) of measuring progress and retention is undeniable, so adult learning principles continue to recommend some aspect of recall or competence evaluation to encourage participation and mastery. Since we just extolled the virtues of video training for EHR implementation, it’s worth mentioning that software solutions like
TechSmith’s Camtasia
offer embedded quizzes that viewers must engage with to continue through a given module. Hospitals and health systems can identify key workflows or functionality that must be grasped prior to go-live, and EHR trainers can even monitor results to flag areas of concern (be it a department or workflow).
Big Fat EHR User Guides Have Their Place
There’s undoubtedly a theme of simplicity and brevity here, which we’re fully aware is no small ask given the complex nature of EHR solutions for health systems. But it’s worth mentioning that the detailed, hefty EHR user guides absolutely have their place. Someone behind the hospital walls has to understand the password complexity rules, what every dropdown means and how to account for the various routing options for completed clinical records. An Epic Super User won’t be set up for success with a quick start guide alone; there must be a detailed resource that covers every little nook and cranny. But for most end users, the key is creating accessibility and reducing the time between EHR training and

The Value of Automated Testing in Healthcare IT
December 23, 2019
314e Employee
Technology Services
If there was one aspect to healthcare IT integration and implementations that insiders would likely point to as not getting nearly enough respect, it’s testing. From functional testing to end-to-end validation,
proper testing of healthcare solutions
can make or break any given deliverable (sometimes quite literally). After all, the use case of an application for hospitals or health systems isn’t just moving data from point A to point B — or rather, provider A to provider B — but to ensure that the PHI maintains security in transit, fidelity in delivery and actionability for the end user. None of these benefits are realized if testing isn’t treated as a priority in the implementation plan. And while there is no doubt that dedicated QA resources are invaluable (which we’ll discuss in more detail later), it’s also prudent at the scale and complexity of modern HIE and EHR integration efforts to incorporate automated testing for the healthcare applications in total.
Accelerate Confidence in Healthcare Integration with Testing
One of the most valuable aspects of automated testing and test case development is a systematic and reproducible way to validate an EHR solution. Because integrations and interoperability efforts are rarely ever done just once, there has to be a reliable way to continually vet and evaluate the stability of a system against established metrics. The only way this is possible is to develop set test cases that are expected to be met consistently over and over again. Even if third-party plug-ins or ancillary EHR systems are added to the core solution, knowing what the base requirements are in terms of data behavior allows for introducing new data (or even just more of the same, much more in the case of a HIE integration) against a known baseline.
The confidence gained by having a set of expected behaviors within the various modules and software being connected for the sake of patient care cannot be overstated in terms of importance. Once you’ve got real PHI flowing in the system, a health organization cannot afford for data elements to go rogue or simply disappear. By running scenarios against established automated test cases with test data first, and then implementing that same automated testing against production data, security and integrity are in tact as both the
sponsoring entity and their HIPAA BAAs
embark on a live, production-ready solution.
Automated Tests Allow for Scale
In addition to
supporting a strong go-live
, automated testing also allows for scalability as providers or entities are bolted on to the healthcare IT solution, or even as the hospital itself grows and acquires new provider groups. While it should be understood that new data elements and workflows may necessarily add additional test cases, it’s far simpler to augment a core set of tests than it is to build something from scratch once the hospital realizes it is in over its head.
Testing accelerators offered by healthcare IT consultants allow for ripping through huge quantities of data (even on
the scale of big data
) while still maintaining reliable scenarios and tracking critical workflows. Especially when managing many different data types and
EHR interface methods
, it quickly becomes far too complex for even the most seasoned healthcare QA experts to get their arms around everything, at least in time for an aggressive deployment schedule (as they generally are, since most hospital clients need better IT solutions since
yesterday
).
The Exponential Power of Human Testers + Automatic Test Cases
We would be remiss to conclude with any sense of downplaying the importance of human testers for healthcare integration delivery. It’s vital to have testers who assume the role of End User and Super User when it comes to properly evaluating the performance of an EHR or HIE solution. Despite incredible advances in automation and AI, there is much to be said for a real-life person who can vet the data, user experience and performance with a perspective that is perhaps most akin to the very attitudes that can either encourage adoption or lead to a painful roll-back.
This is where the value of QA resources
and
automated testing can exponentially add value to the solution delivered to busy healthcare professionals who expect stability, quality and intuitiveness. As those of us in the healthcare IT space know, these are base metrics and yet no small feat to accomplish. Health data spans many formats, standards, specialities and ranges, but it’s up to those in the weeds to make heads or tails of these variables so that a physician on the front lines can make the right decision, based on the right data in the right place.
Marrying together the incredible scalability and reliability of automated testing with the irreplaceable, hands-on experience of human testing professionals is the strongest way that we can collectively deploy EHR solutions that move the needle on care and improve outcomes.

EHR Interfaces: Pursuing More than Data for Data’s Sake
December 18, 2019
314e Employee
EHR Services
The challenges associated with connecting multiple, disparate EHR systems — be it ancillary provider or private clinic to hospital or health system, or any combo therein — are not to be taken lightly. Every data point in healthcare IT represents a potential decision-point that, in error or omission, has significant implications for patient outcomes. The driving force behind EHR integration efforts is often consolidating patient records to get a more comprehensive view, but amassing data alone could actually be more of a hindrance or even a risk, especially where liability is concerned. Throwing a laundry list of diagnoses, reports and labs at a physician isn’t going to improve patient outcomes. However, when the approach for
EHR interfaces
and creating interoperability is in pursuit of a meaningful view of medical records, then the ROIs associated with integration are within grasp and truly impactful for the hospital or health system.
Prioritize EHR Interfaces For Quick Wins At The Point Of Care
Not all data is created equal in terms of value, trustworthiness or accessibility. When EHR interface efforts are focused on the connectivity that will solve the most pressing problems for the health system, it’s far more likely that the juice will be worth the squeeze, as they say. Because this varies by community and health plan, it’s vital that interoperability leaders in a care setting create a sense of need and value for the various interfaces to better focus on where to start establishing immediate gains. Asking a private practice or ancillary provider to heavily engage their IT department for EHR integration can be a hard sell, but when the value proposition for both parties is well articulated and the intentionality of the connection is established, there’s a far better chance that the project will move forward well and with the right engagement.
Driving Population Health With Epic Interfaces
If one of the biggest challenges for population health management for a given community is getting radiology reports back into the hands of the PCPs or specialists who are soon-after working with patients to develop a care plan, for example, then there are a few key steps that could solve this sooner than later:
Identify which radiology provider sees the majority of these at-risk patients (which may be different from the provider who sees just a majority of patients in general)
Establish a relationship between the sponsoring entity (such as the Epic hospital) and the radiology groups to openly discuss needs and opportunities
Learn about the healthcare IT capabilities of that radiology group, in terms of their tech stack, existing integration points, data standards in place, etc.
Create a plan for bridging the gap in terms of capabilities and requirements to create interoperability between both entities (which could mean leveraging hospital resources or even funds to make it happen)
Drive EHR integration to improve the speed at which the radiology reports are available to physicians in the EMR
It’s just that simple! …If only. These are the high level steps to making meaningful progress on overall integration progress that will benefit the whole care continuum
because
it focuses on a specific, local need.
Create an Epic Interface Roadmap For The Health System
Since we’ve established the value of starting EHR interface efforts with strategy, this is a great opportunity to speak to the importance of an integration roadmap to create short- and long-term steps toward interoperability. There are a few different approaches that a health system can take when it comes to identifying their roadmap, and it’s a very personal decision based on the unique, community-level needs, such as:
Simplest to most complex data standards to learn-as-you-go
Biggest to smallest provider partners to quickly close the data gap
Well-established provider partners first to grasp low-hanging fruit
The driving point is that the Epic interface roadmap should reflect the capabilities and priorities of the collective community, as this will create a sense of shared value from the get-go. Gathering large amounts of data alone won’t solve problems; in fact, it could introduce a whole host of new, very messy ones. Prioritizing the
right
connections, implementing toward a bigger picture goal and
testing interfaces mercilessly
along the way can completely change the face of care delivery for providers and patients alike.

Planning for Smooth Epic Upgrades and Optimization
January 8, 2020
314e Employee
EHR Services
Congrats, you’ve successfully deployed your Epic instance and are humming along! There’s no lingering
legacy EHR system
, physicians and support staff are using the tool as expected, and the implementation team has disbanded. Three cheers for a fantastic Epic
EHR Implementation
! …But wait. There’s an Epic upgrade that needs implementing. While this isn’t starting from square one, it is nevertheless a unique beast to tackle. Whereas integrating Epic for the first time in a health system may be more complex and require a formal cut over,
EHR optimization and upgrade
efforts are sometimes just as tricky, given you’re making changes to a (presumably) stable, live environment. How can you mitigate risk and ensure that the update doesn’t cause more problems than it solves?
Let’s look at a few key ways that hospitals can plan for Epic upgrades that won’t take the whole organization offline in the process.
Don’t Underestimate the Project Needs
More precisely, don’t underestimate how many people it will take to execute the Epic upgrade. In our experience, where most health systems end up in hot water is not properly staffing their support team in anticipation of a system change. These are at times the very same organizations that pulled out all the stops when it came to the initial implementation, but the perception of subsequent efforts were deceptively minimal, leading to insufficient (or improper) resources to make sure that day-to-day operations could sustain the updates.
Staff Up and Communicate Upgrade Goals…No Matter the Size
Maybe you don’t fire up the entire team, but ensuring that representatives from all the major avenues — including: on-site IT, vendor development teams, training, change management, etc. — are at the very least informed of the updates and will encourage the appropriate level of visibility to prevent huge delays in execution and troubleshooting. After all, if the first that someone is hearing about Epic optimization work is when you hand them a raging fire, you shouldn’t expect prompt resolution or even willingness to assist (speaking of raging fires, setting priorities for someone else without consideration for their existing workload rarely goes over well).
If the changes are important enough to warrant the efforts at all, then they’re important enough to run through all the proper change and communication channels to execute well.
Plan for Delay in Care Delivery During Epic Upgrades
While the assessment of risk for a given update may be minor, it’s nevertheless prudent to assume that there will be some level of delay in care delivery. This may simply be an EHR that is lagging upon login, or an integration “refresh” that is causing delays in otherwise-speedy data transactions to support point-of-care activity. When end users can be dissuaded from using healthcare IT solutions based on a handful of extra clicks, considering the clinical impact to workflows is massive. Communicating potential delays or even brief outages goes a long way in projecting a sense of respect and ownership of issues, indicating they’re expected and being handled (versus waiting for users to grumble, which is rarely perceived well).
For major Epic upgrades and heavier handed optimization efforts, it’s not a bad idea to staff up for at-the-elbow support on the care floor. Imagine the perception of support when end users and busy clinicians have real-time assistance to overcome barriers or even report unexpected bugs without having to break stride!
Emphasize Training Opportunities to Support Epic Upgrades
Whether the Epic solution has been running in a health system for a month or for many years, there’s a tendency beyond
EHR go-live
for end users to assume that subsequent training isn’t necessary, expecting changes to be low impact or intuitive. It’s critical for upgrade and optimization efforts for any EHR to be supported by the same kind of quality training materials that were available during initial deployment. Epic Quick Start Guides may be perfectly sufficient to cover new content and workflows, but regardless, they must be provided in a timely manner, and in a way that is logically accessible to end users. (If it’s well known that no one logs into the employee portal, for example, then that’s not the best place for those valuable resources to live.)
By treating every upgrade as a mini-implementation, regardless of the ultimate impact to end users, Epic project teams are far more likely to fare well and get the support needed to execute change well.

The Importance of Logistics for Epic Go-Live Support
January 15, 2020
314e Employee
EHR Services
It’s no surprise that the roster for any given Epic implementation team is largely project and technical savvy resources. While these critical team members are no doubt experts in their respective areas — be it EHR integrations and APIs, project management, or QA — there is a little discussed element of
successful Epic go-live
that simply can’t be ignored: logistics. When details matter (and they do), it’s vital that the right skillsets are tapped to ensure that roll-out happens smoothly, training is executed well, and that busy clinicians have the information they need for a great Epic launch and adoption.
“I’m a Project Manager, not a Travel Agent!”
While Technical Project Managers are generally detail oriented and reliable, assuming that they will cover all the logistics for a large-scale Epic go-live is a poor assignment. Sure, they’ve probably got what it takes, but coordinating Epic at-the-elbow (ATE) support is not a small feat. When Certified Epic Trainers are brought in for go-live support, making sure flights are booked, rides are scheduled, hotels are arranged and training spaces are reserved is a time-consuming task. After all, if appropriate measures aren’t taken to bring together all the support resources, then end users may find themselves struggling to effectively use the EHR.
Designating a Logistics Coordinator for large Epic go-live gives ownership for:
Airline bookings
A/V support
Car rental/ride-share arrangements
Classroom coordination for training
Hotel bookings
Meals and snacks — don’t underestimate the power of a well-fed project team!
…and much more!
Leaving the important tasks of travel coordination and resource gathering to already-tapped project team members can lead to burnout at the worst possible time, as well as overlooked tasks that could create chaos when clarity is paramount.
“Stranded at the Airport…Send Help!”
While we’re certainly proponents of bringing in Credentialed Epic Trainers for go-live support, it won’t do you much good if they never make it from point A to point B. Since many highly-skilled Epic experts are located throughout the country, travel is often necessary and should be well coordinated to avoid wasted time and lost revenue. An experienced Logistics Coordinator for large EHR projects can help to secure blocked hotel rooms, for example, which makes transporting all of the at-the-elbow support team far more efficient, not to mention fosters a sense of teamwork that will greatly benefit the Epic implementation efforts.
It’s the job of the logistics manager to carefully coordinate every detail that gets the right people, at the right time, in the right place.
EHR Training Logistics: “Does Anyone have a Pen?”
One of the elements of hospital EHR implementations that can take up significant planning power is
training in preparation for Epic go-live
Logistics for EHR training includes:
Scheduling training sessions to reach all end users
Booking classrooms
Setting up A/V requirements to support training
Taking attendance and tracking participation
Training material gathering and distribution — don’t forget the pens for note-takers!
Facilitating training webinars
Answering project questions and gathering feedback
While there is no aspect of Epic implementation efforts that go unnoticed, adeptly executing training in preparation for go-live can make or break the experience for everyone. Implementation teams will be challenged with unprepared clinical users, clinical users will be flustered and delayed in taking care of their patients, patients will be irritated with said delays and flustered physicians and hospital executives will have quite a mess on their hands to clean up.
Details are critical for Epic go-live support, so consider it a necessity to name a skilled resource to own logistics for every step of delivery — from training to at-the-elbow assistance. This is work that goes unnoticed when it’s done well, or brings everything to a grinding halt when done poorly. Let’s aim for the former.

3 Ways to Gain Buy-In from Ancillary Providers for Epic Integration
December 4, 2019
314e Employee
EHR Services
Health systems embarking on
Epic integration projects
are rarely doing so to exist in a bubble. The goal we often hear from clients is establishing the right healthcare IT solution to support collaborative care, making population health attainable and more efficient. As the days of fee-for-service are behind us, large hospitals must approach their care delivery philosophy as encompassing a whole network of care providers, many of whom may reside outside their network. To this end, getting the support and commitment from ancillary providers and strategic outpatient clinics to connect to and participate in efforts to improve the technical solutions supporting the community (including an Epic EHR implementation) is required.
Let’s examine a few ways that leaders in local health systems can secure buy-in from providers outside of their direct sphere of influence (i.e. outside of the hospital system) to drive successful Epic integration.
We’ve talked before about
the importance of communication when it comes to setting expectations
and encouraging buy-in, but it bears repeating often. If you, as an Epic integration project leader, want to demonstrate the desire to forge a true partnership with ancillary providers and health clinics connecting to the hospital system, creating opportunities for discussion and updates are vital. By including from the beginning the very providers you want to participate in your collaborative solution — be it an integrated EHR or eventually a HIE — you not only get more feedback and valuable insight, but you set the stage for smooth(er) roll out.
Action Step: Establish a Community Council for your Epic Integration
Creating a council or collaborative of community healthcare providers is a great way to define the integration approach from a practical perspective, as well as discuss the kind of specifics that, in their absence, could sink adoption. For example, configuring an Epic instance without considering the nature and format of data outside the hospital could result in a far more complex (and lengthy) EHR integration. On the other hand, chatting with the technical leads from facilities that will eventually connect to your Epic instance helps form requirements that will translate to a solid instance with true interoperability. This is truly a win for the whole community, including your shared patients!
One of the most impressive community IPA initiatives observed (which eventually became a full-blown
managed care organization
) came as a direct result of incentivizing providers outside of their umbrella. This can take several forms, but a pipeline of steady referrals is basically a win-win. Not only does the friendly ancillary provider get plenty of referred patients, but the overall EHR solution will be far better leveraged when populated with plenty of data from well-integrated partners. And this doesn’t even speak to the enhanced patient experience of true continuity of care, in which every provider has access to the type of PHI they need to do their job better. Well-developed EHR interfaces (and lots of them) can change the face of healthcare for an entire community, so the value cannot be overstated.
Action Step: Create Metrics Based on Unique, Local Needs
So what are these best practices for Epic? Until you have the buy-in (mentioned first) and steady utilization of the interfaces (which we just covered), it’s moot to discuss using it well. First, you must secure an integrated EHR. Beyond that, the sponsoring entity establishing Epic on behalf of the overall health system should set metrics and expectations around usage that can drive referrals, perks, etc. for using the system optimally. Typically, focusing on key ROIs will help form the basis for initiatives around use and interoperability to solve pain points or move the needle on the data points that matter most to the community at hand. After all, it’s the work of leadership across the care spectrum for a given demographic to look at their unique needs and craft creative ways to meet them with the players at the table.
It may seem counterintuitive to suggest that a tactic for securing buy-in is to assume that some ancillary providers won’t buy in. But in our experience, rose-colored glasses will only get you so far in the face of overburdened administrators and IT departments. By acknowledging that some community partners will not be excited about the idea of exchanging data or integrating with Epic, hospital leaders are far more likely to find a creative, respectful solution to obtaining that valued data. Whether it’s concern that transparency with outside organizations will reveal weakness or even shoddy compliance practices, or that an abundance of data creates more liability than ancillary clinics are willing to accept, it’s valuable to hear these concerns (even if you’ve got to read between the lines to gather this intel).
Action Step: Develop a Phased Approach to Epic Integration
Realizing that the whole community of care providers isn’t going to jump on board day 1, planning for Epic integration that can span several phases will fare far better in real life. Creating space for early and late adopters facilitates an integration plan to deliver Epic to serve an entire community without stalling over delays and feet dragging. Focusing on key interfaces to drive Epic adoption within the sponsoring health system will give the most bang for the proverbial buck, while planning for the eventual connectivity that really changes healthcare across the spectrum of providers and patients in the area.

How to Deliver the Best Epic Training in the Industry
November 7, 2019
314e Employee
EHR Services
There are many ways that a health system can choose to implement an EHR such as Epic. Some take the slow and steady approach, while others need fast and furious. Regardless of the pace or size of the implementation team, a critical aspect of
EHR implementation
is training. Skimping on the right resources and materials for delivering Epic training can make all the difference between a great Go-Live and one that fails to launch.
Today we’re going to share a few ways that hospitals and large healthcare organizations can encourage Epic adoption by providing efficient, effective training to their end-users.
Set the Stage for Epic Implementation Over and Over Again
Perhaps because Epic training often occurs toward the end of the project plan, it’s often assumed that end-users know exactly what they’re getting and therefore what they should be learning. But, this is an error in assumption! It’s always a good idea to take a few moments to set the stage in terms of the goals and timelines of the project to help clinical staff, physicians, and Super Users understand the big picture for the EHR roll out. When trainers dive right into features and functions, they miss the opportunity to instill
intrinsic motivation for participation
and support of the implementation, whether it’s a totally new system or simply an upgrade.
The Payoff
Shifting end users from a position of “this is being done to me” to a perspective of “this is being done
for
me” can have significant impacts on adoption and overall satisfaction with their powerful new tool for delivering excellent patient care.
Focus on Relevant Epic Workflows and Test Cases for Training
One of the biggest mistakes we’ve seen when it comes to training on any EHR, especially one as robust as Epic, is that instructors expect attendees to connect the dots from functionality to meaningful workflows. Training cases and example flows should be designed with the end user in mind. By focusing on relevant data elements and efficiency gains provided by the tool, clinical users are far more likely to grasp the information presented and quickly implement what they’ve learned. It admittedly takes more time and effort, but when a trainer takes the time to understand the business needs of the hospital or health system, and incorporates real life scenarios and pain points into the learning, the traction gained is incredible.
The Payoff
Providing Epic users with tangible, applicable use cases and realistic sample data during training will close the gap between concept and practice, setting a clear path for successful Epic Go-Live.
Don’t be Afraid to be Repetitive on Core Use Cases
While the aforementioned practice of incorporating relevant test cases for training can go a long way, it’s worth a reminder that most people need to hear a piece of information several times before it is retained. One way to minimize Information Fallout is to utilize a “hands on” mechanism during training to quickly encourage application of the content learned during the training session, be it virtual or live classroom setting. But it bears repeating that repetition is powerful, especially for crystalizing core use cases and new workflows into the muscle memory (and actual memory) of clinical end users. If physicians and their support staff have heard just once how they’re expected to utilize their Epic instance the morning of Go-Live, it’s far more likely that the implementation will require more hands-on support to make it through those critical days to see adoption through.
The Payoff
Plenty of practice with vital modules and workflows will minimize Epic implementation roadblocks and headaches. Quantity and quality matter when it comes to EHR training, so don’t be afraid to create natural cycles of review in course material to encourage knowledge transfer.
Create Engaging Epic Training Materials for a Modern Audience
Since we mentioned quality when it comes to training materials, it’s critical that Epic training resources are created and delivered with a modern audience in mind. Handing over a sizable user guide to a busy clinician is not going to result in a well-versed end user. No one has time to read through all that content, save for maybe a designated Super User whose job it is to become a walking user guide. Leveraging multiple forms of learning, from in-person and high touch instruction to an efficient interactive eLearning approach, is a great way to appeal to your audience while still providing valuable information to facilitate their understanding of Epic. Video content is another great way to meet users where they are, allowing for engagement with training content on their own schedule, though we highly recommend shorter video segments to this end, as well as measurable quizzes to ensure completion and comprehension.
The Payoff
Great
Epic training
materials allow for a self-service mechanism for end users to utilize post-training, minimizing the need for long-term external resource alliance, as well as a more efficient means of overcoming blockers.

EHR Implementation and Optimization Projects – Perfect Opportunities to Fix Your Processes
November 30, 2018
314e Employee
EHR Services
When you buy a new car, do you ask the dealer to make sure it has all the problems your old car had?
Problem
When it comes to healthcare technology, there are three key focus areas: People, Processes, and [EHR] Product. In most implementations, the focus is on the end product, the technology result – the shiny new object. However, implementers too often try to emulate the system being replaced…which was designed to address operational processes of 20 years earlier.
Instead of seizing the opportunity to optimize patient registration, enhancing the patient experience, or providing cleaner claims, the new system is contorted to match the old processes, leading to millions of dollars in lost revenue. This not only negatively impacts profitability, it ultimately impacts patient care. This article underscores the importance of managing people and processes regardless of the EHR system being implemented or optimized.
Background
The great thing about state-of-the-art hospital software is that given enough time and money, you can make it do almost anything. The bad thing is – you guessed it – you can make it do almost anything. Before anyone downloads new software or touches a keyboard, it is imperative to understand how the new system operates natively compared to your organization’s operational processes and staffing models. There will undoubtedly be instances when your “customary” operational approach will need to be modified; you ideally want to reconstruct your process flows to blend industry best-practices with the natural design of the software.
If this was easy, every implementation would be a raging success.
Engaging the right resources to successfully scope and implement a new system – or launch an effort to optimize an existing one – is a crucial first step. These resources need to have an in-depth understanding of hospital operational processes as well as your new system’s capabilities.
Timeline
The early phases of an implementation include planning, discovery, and education. During these phases an organization must ensure that it is laying a solid foundation for the program’s overall success. Prior to developing organizational goals and timelines, the project and executive leadership teams need to establish their overall vision and guiding principles. This is the cornerstone of the project.
The vision should remain at the forefront and should be communicated through all levels of leadership, and across all operational areas. Once the vision and guiding principles are established, the goals and timelines can be set. A key success factor is to never lose sight of the vision; ensuring that all leaders are on the same page is crucial. They must disseminate the same, consistent message to all levels of the organization.
Realizing Value of EHR Projects
EHR system implementations are initiated to increase value while reducing cost, yielding a defined ROI over time. The value of implementing an EHR project is not always immediately calculable. For example, it is hard to put a number on the EHR component of increasing overall patient experience, however it plays an important role in the success of an organization. The more tangible items are typically achieved by reducing manual intervention (reducing errors, generating cleaner initial claims, etc.) and by utilizing the built-in efficiencies delivered standard in new systems.
The breakdown often occurs during the discovery and design phases. During the discovery phase, it is crucial to understand the current operational processes, but the goal is not to carry over the exact same processes and workflows to the new system, but to ensure that nothing is missed in its design.
The design should use the new system’s inherent best practices, changing only the native functionality when necessary with minimal customization. There are items that will need customization specific to the organization. These may require operational staffing changes and updated processes, but rather than moving staff out, the intent is to shift staff to more value-added tasks.
Strategy
Many organizations have already completed the new implementation phases of their projects and are fully live or are on a phased rollout schedule, but it is worth investing the time and resources to optimize processes. Also, continued consolidation is forcing many EHR users to switch systems despite being fully implemented and satisfied, but this too is an opportunity to optimize operations.
Due to the complexity and time it takes from the initial phase to stabilization (typically years) the system may have already (or should have) gone through one or more upgrade cycles. As the user community becomes acquainted with the system, many processes that were initially efficient may need to be reexamined.
The key areas on which to focus optimization efforts (system & operational) are:
Patient Facing Areas (Scheduling & Registration) & Real-Time Eligibility
Charge Router & Charge Capture
Claim Processing Logic & Rules
Anesthesia & Research Billing
Clinical Touch Points
Value-Based Care Workflows
In many organizations, only bare-minimum upgrades (e.g.: regulatory updates and system break-fixes) are undertaken. This is sometimes the result of insufficient resources, but is frequently because the team is unaware of newly added capabilities. However, the real value of today’s systems comes from capitalizing on new (or previously ignored) functionality that enhance the overall value of your investment.
To maximize value, an organization must put forth the time and effort to review enhancements from both a technological and operational perspective. Reviewing these key areas for efficiencies could have a huge positive impact not only on your bottom line, but more importantly on patient care and experience.
Most hospitals cannot afford to keep a team of EHR software experts on staff permanently – i.e. people that know hospital operations, the underlying technology of the EHR systems installed, and the functional enhancements the software vendors have added. But the good news is that hospitals don’t need to permanently employ such talent; it can be “rented”. The additional benefit is that talent from outside sources come with the knowledge of how dozens of other facilities are leveraging the same software, and the experience to exploit it.
Conclusion
With the industry shifting from volume to value, healthcare organizations need to ensure that they get the most value from their investments. 314e offers services to partner with your organization from system selection and pre-implementation planning through optimization, stabilization and ongoing support.

How to Deliver the Best Epic Training in the Industry
November 7, 2019
314e Employee
EHR Services
There are many ways that a health system can choose to implement an EHR such as Epic. Some take the slow and steady approach, while others need fast and furious. Regardless of the pace or size of the implementation team, a critical aspect of
EHR implementation
is training. Skimping on the right resources and materials for delivering Epic training can make all the difference between a great Go-Live and one that fails to launch.
Today we’re going to share a few ways that hospitals and large healthcare organizations can encourage Epic adoption by providing efficient, effective training to their end-users.
Set the Stage for Epic Implementation Over and Over Again
Perhaps because Epic training often occurs toward the end of the project plan, it’s often assumed that end-users know exactly what they’re getting and therefore what they should be learning. But, this is an error in assumption! It’s always a good idea to take a few moments to set the stage in terms of the goals and timelines of the project to help clinical staff, physicians, and Super Users understand the big picture for the EHR roll out. When trainers dive right into features and functions, they miss the opportunity to instill
intrinsic motivation for participation
and support of the implementation, whether it’s a totally new system or simply an upgrade.
The Payoff
Shifting end users from a position of “this is being done to me” to a perspective of “this is being done
for
me” can have significant impacts on adoption and overall satisfaction with their powerful new tool for delivering excellent patient care.
Focus on Relevant Epic Workflows and Test Cases for Training
One of the biggest mistakes we’ve seen when it comes to training on any EHR, especially one as robust as Epic, is that instructors expect attendees to connect the dots from functionality to meaningful workflows. Training cases and example flows should be designed with the end user in mind. By focusing on relevant data elements and efficiency gains provided by the tool, clinical users are far more likely to grasp the information presented and quickly implement what they’ve learned. It admittedly takes more time and effort, but when a trainer takes the time to understand the business needs of the hospital or health system, and incorporates real life scenarios and pain points into the learning, the traction gained is incredible.
The Payoff
Providing Epic users with tangible, applicable use cases and realistic sample data during training will close the gap between concept and practice, setting a clear path for successful Epic Go-Live.
Don’t be Afraid to be Repetitive on Core Use Cases
While the aforementioned practice of incorporating relevant test cases for training can go a long way, it’s worth a reminder that most people need to hear a piece of information several times before it is retained. One way to minimize Information Fallout is to utilize a “hands on” mechanism during training to quickly encourage application of the content learned during the training session, be it virtual or live classroom setting. But it bears repeating that repetition is powerful, especially for crystalizing core use cases and new workflows into the muscle memory (and actual memory) of clinical end users. If physicians and their support staff have heard just once how they’re expected to utilize their Epic instance the morning of Go-Live, it’s far more likely that the implementation will require more hands-on support to make it through those critical days to see adoption through.
The Payoff
Plenty of practice with vital modules and workflows will minimize Epic implementation roadblocks and headaches. Quantity and quality matter when it comes to EHR training, so don’t be afraid to create natural cycles of review in course material to encourage knowledge transfer.
Create Engaging Epic Training Materials for a Modern Audience
Since we mentioned quality when it comes to training materials, it’s critical that Epic training resources are created and delivered with a modern audience in mind. Handing over a sizable user guide to a busy clinician is not going to result in a well-versed end user. No one has time to read through all that content, save for maybe a designated Super User whose job it is to become a walking user guide. Leveraging multiple forms of learning, from in-person and high touch instruction to an efficient interactive eLearning approach, is a great way to appeal to your audience while still providing valuable information to facilitate their understanding of Epic. Video content is another great way to meet users where they are, allowing for engagement with training content on their own schedule, though we highly recommend shorter video segments to this end, as well as measurable quizzes to ensure completion and comprehension.
The Payoff
Great
Epic training
materials allow for a self-service mechanism for end users to utilize post-training, minimizing the need for long-term external resource alliance, as well as a more efficient means of overcoming blockers.
